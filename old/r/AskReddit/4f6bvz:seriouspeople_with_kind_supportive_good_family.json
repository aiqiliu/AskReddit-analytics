He died at 25 in August after nearly a decade of drug and alcohol abuse.\n\nWhen he hit puberty (middle school) he started acting out at school and wearing all black. He would constantly get into fights and practically lived in detention. He went from an honors student to a straight F student over the course of about two years. He started smoking as much weed as he could and experimenting with whatever else he could get his hands on (alcohol, cough syrup, you name it and he tried to get high off it). My parents took every disciplinary action you can take on a young teenager but he only rebelled harder.\n\nBy his later teens he had began to focus his efforts on getting alcohol. He would go to our local grocery store and steal a bottle almost daily for years. At this point my parents knew it was no longer a question of discipline but rather a deeper psychological issue. He spent many stints in rehab and visited every psychiatrist my parents could find. He also had several trips to jail for petty offenses.\n\nOne thing that allowed him to continue was the fact that my parents were split up. My dad was much stricter than my mom and my mom would work long hours for her job. The long hours were so we could go to college and whatnot, but what happened was they allowed my brother to do whatever he wanted at my mom's house. He used this as his safehouse where he could do whatever he wanted, and with this there was never any real incentive to stop doing whatever his drug of choice was at the time.\n\nBy the time he was 16 he refused to go to my dad's house at all and their relationship became strained. Every night there were fights between my mom, dad, and brother. My dad would come over to my mom's to see us and pick me up to go to his house and there would inevitably be a problem because my brother would high/drunk/angry/whatever. Looking back is hard because I have more or less tried to remove this part of my life (ages 13-18) from memory.\n\nAfter high school what few friends he had left went their separate ways and he became very isolated. He would hold jobs for 1-2 years before being fired for alcohol-related issues. Between jobs he would drown himself in various intoxicants and almost always end up with a trip to the ER for some sort of poisoning.\n\nThis cycle continued for about 7 years, until he went into his bedroom at my mothers house and took his final dose on August 11, 2015.\n\nI can write more about how I turned out or answer any questions for people experiencing something similar.", "downs": 0, "stickied": false, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1460903369.0, "ups": 298, "mod_reports": []}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"removal_reason": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"removal_reason": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"removal_reason": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "PM_ME_AARON_SCHOCK", "score": 3, "controversiality": 0, "body": "RemindMe! 6 hours \"Check for reply\"", "downs": 0, "stickied": false, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1460913773.0, "ups": 3, "mod_reports": []}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "nucular_mastermind", "score": 8, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Hey, congratulations on the turnaroung!

Unfortunately, I found those friends in the wrong crowd, people who partied a lot and were generally wastrels. Family was well educated and did not so much as drink.

I've always been smart so I've managed to find a way out of the  hood, I now attend a university an hour away from my neighborhood and have two pretty good jobs.

I grew up with \"thugs'  who sold and did drugs on a daily, and I myself love drugs as well. My life isn't a mess but it could be way better if I actually put some effort into building a good life.

It's important to regularly look out at the field you're studying for, the jobs, opportunities available, I regularly look at graduate jobs, I can't wait to graduate and have a starting salary alone as much as both of my parents combined right now, and from trends and friends I know that it'll practically double over some 3-4 years of working as long as I keep myself interested.  \n  \nI think the most important thing to keep in mind when you're going through shit feelings is to think macro, think about not just how the little things feel right now, but remind yourself to be on some path of progress, and as you go along this path you'll get more and more motivation.   \n  \nEdit: And the most important thing to always know in life - everyone's a fucking faker, everyone knows sweet fuck all and is just pretending, and if they're sorta on the ball but sound confident enough they'll seem like they know the answer to every question, that's all it is, and all you can ever really know is how much you know - or don't know, and simply being aware of how little others know will help you get the confidence in the little that you do know, and with humility and interest you can grow that little to be a little more than their little.  \nAll the world's a stage,  \nAnd all the men and women merely players;   \n  \n  \nEdit2 Return of the Edit: And don't feel bad about your sister for example, or anyone else you might be envious of, life's such a game of luck it's ridiculous when you look back on it, so much in life depends on things that are completely out of your control, things that we often attribute to random chance, the only thing you have control over is what you do, so don't give up when someone succeeds, just keep doing what you do, keep being you and follow CIVs philosophy - you can't start a new turn unless you have something researching or building, something should always be happening and that'll mean that you're moving forward, towards something greater than what you have now, be it either from experience, or financial, or relationships or knowledge, but always moving forward, never stagnating, never leaving yourself behind.", "downs": 0, "stickied": false, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1460908033.0, "ups": 39, "mod_reports": []}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"removal_reason": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "suddenimpulse", "score": 7, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Don't drop out.

My siblings turned out to be excellent in every aspect of their lives; really good in school and university, well-liked by everyone, yadda-yadda. I was always rather shy, but when I hit puberty I was increasingly anxious around other people. I was bullied sometimes but yeah, many people were bullied and it was never really bad. Nevertheless, my life came to the point that I was terrified every night to go to bed because I knew I had to go to school the next morning. Whenever possible, I only slept 2, 3 hours to prolong the night because I told myself \"As long as you don't fall asleep, it's still evening and the next school day is tomorrow, not today\" (which is stupid, I know, but that's how I \"worked\"). I was severely depressed and anxious, almost paranoid, at the age of 15 and seriously contemplating suicide. Not because I was really sure my life wasn't worth living, but I just couldn't see another way to finally find some peace. And silence. Always being hyped up by anxiety made me so fucking tired. \n\nI'm glad I didn't drop out of school. Still don't know how it worked, but I finished school. At the time I was finally on some kind of medication, after a short talk with a not really interested physician. It wasn't great, panic attacks came and went, but I was working enough to finish school. \nMy parents - who love me very much, and always did - where increasingly more concerned, but they didn't really understand what was wrong with me. They couldn't understand how my siblings were successful and well-liked whereas I was always unapproachable, aggressive and always alone in my room. I remember my mother asking me how I could say I was not happy, growing up in a loving family in a beautiful huge house in the country. \n\nLong story (not so) short:.In the last years my life has improved tremendously. For 10 years, it was hell on earth for me. Yes, I had the best family and all possibilities for a good start into adulthood, but it didn't work out. But after a stay at a psychiatric center I got the best medication and suddenly I felt a lot... relieved? Like something heavy was removed from my stomach. I've had some relapses, but it's far easier to cope with them when you know that there ARE ways to help you live a happy life. I react rather quickly when I start to feel the weight again, and nowadays I'm able to have a good job, the best girlfriend and many plans for the future! \n\nGet help soon, I beg you.

I smoked weed and did mushrooms, and eventually graduated to snorting coke and smoking crack.\n\nI look back on my druggie days and am flabbergasted that I never OD'd and died. I made a lot of bad choices and did some pretty bad things. \n\nThe luckiest day of my life (though it didn't feel lucky at the time) was the day my dealer/roommate was arrested and he (incorrectly) decided that it must have been me that snitched on him. He ran me out of town and told everyone I was a rat. I ended up homeless and without any contacts in a different town and that was the push I needed to clean myself up. I ended up going cold turkey and quit everything. Been clean for 6 years now.\n\n*edit, I meant to add that was estranged from my family during my druggie years, but after I cleaned myself up we got back in contact and I slowly won back their love and trust. I now have a good relationship with them again. I have a sister who is 3.5 years younger than me and luckily she learned from my mistakes. She was always a very good, incredibly smart kid.

Next thing we know there are 20 members of various law enforcement departments in the apartment with pistols and shotguns pointed at our chests.\r\rWe got lucky as we'd just sold off the three or so pounds we'd picked up the day before, but they got us and everything in the apartment. Three ounces, pills, coke, scales, bags, $5000 (although they took some and only reported $1900 of it), 22 pieces, etc.\r\rTook us in, and charged us with third degree felonies.\r\rMy family was devastated but supportive. We got probation, my buddy moved away, and I started working at a pizza place just trying to survive.\r\rSince then I've been clean, but never done anything with my life. I work in lawn care and get by, but I squandered the best years of my life on carnal pleasure and greed.\r\rOn a happier note I've reconnected with my family, I have two precious nephews that I love, and me and my buddy reconnected as well.

I was heavily addicted to amphetamines, as I had been on them for ten years at this time, and I sank into myself and cut off the outside world. My family tried their best but kids don't come with a manual and broken kids less so. Ended up in rehab/psyche center by 20, had a failed attempt to join the Army within months of quitting drugs. Got out and drank my pain and misery away. Partied, ended up in weird situations, wound up with an abusive gf/wife for three years, which made the drinking worse. Upon leaving that relationship, I developed bulimia and subsequently anorexia. Wound up in a RCF, got sober, got put on disability and basically just floated til I was 30.

I wasn't lazy, I just never saw the point of dedicating all of your youth to school and then straight to work. For what? Money? I've always had other interests. It was the constant pressure to succeed and the high expectations mixed with issues surrounding being a throwaway kid that made me go over the edge. At 15 I started smoking weed and drinking. LSD at 17. Then things calmed down and I started doing better in school after being unofficially mentored by a like minded teacher. \n\nThen college came and I was taking over 100mg of adderall with vodka daily and blowing off class. It took six years to find a major I could enjoy in outdoor education. The drinking and amphetamine abuse never really calmed down in that six years. I graduated and all my friends left town. I sat alone at home doing speed, drinking vodka, and shooting small game in the backyard. At work I would just get drunk and wash dishes. Every night. \n\nI finally got a job in wilderness therapy and helped a lot of people. It was forced sobriety for the 16 day shift and that did me a world of good. I got my confidence and self worth back. I quit the amphetamine and stuck with the job for two years. I fell in love with a girl there and we got very deeply involved.

It started to wear on our relationship and on top of that she decided she wanted to get to the root of it with me. We just ended up dredging up a bunch of shit I had repressed for good reason.\n\n I got caught drinking on shift. Lost my job and likely blew my shot at finding a job like that again. I had been planning to move to CO with my roommate for two years prior so we figured let's just do it. My gf was aware of the plans and made me feel safe in believing that she was going to meet me here after six months. Three weeks in she told me she was exhausted and couldn't be with me anymore. I had been planning to propose. That was two months ago. I'm happier in CO and though I'm 26 and educated and still spending my days drinking in the dish room the silver lining is that I don't touch alcohol on my days off, because I just don't want it. \n\nTLDR: Pressure to succeed and expectations I had no interest in coupled with issues surrounding adoption have contributed to a solid decade of substance abuse.", "downs": 0, "stickied": false, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1460917156.0, "ups": 1, "mod_reports": []}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"removal_reason": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "potatoshot", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Okay, so I grew up with two loving and very supportive parents, who are still married to this day. I am the oldest (20 years old) with two younger siblings. My family life was very stable, and I've never seen my parents fight, let alone have an argument. I grew up in an upper class suburban neighborhood on the east coast, where every family that lived there consisted of doctors, lawyers or business professionals. \n      When I was born I had a very traumatic birth, where I was separated from my mom for about 3 days. This later caused me to have severe un-diagnosed anxiety for most of my life. I always had friends but never really felt like I fit in with any of them. As I got older and throughout highschool I received pretty good grades, A- average. But was still dealing with severe anxiety, so I tried to not to excel in anything (to avoid being singled out). I started drinking and smoking weed at 15, but that's was normal for most high school kids. The summer before my senior year, I went to a music festival and discovered MDMA. Which I fell in love with. All of my anxiety and mental issues just slipped away while I was on it. \n      I started going to more shows and taking it more regularly. From there I started experimenting with other drugs. Mostly psychedelics at the time. But my parents had no idea because my grades were good and my home life was normal. \n      At this time I was also struggling to maintain any friend groups and was feeling really depressed and alone. But never chose to bring it up to anyone. From there I got into a University in Southern California, and left as soon as possible. Sure I missed my family during this transition, but I was hoping that a new beginning would remove all my problems. \n     Once I started school, I loved it. I made some true friends and ended up joining a fraternity. Which allowed me to drink and party 4-5 nights a week. At this time, the E I was taking (about every two weeks to month) was not doing the job anymore. So I started taking a lot of cocaine and Xanax. Along with adderal. This usage carried on into my sophomore year. That's when things started to hit the fan. I was very depressed/suicidal and began using almost every day just to not feel depressed.\n     My parents at this time we're starting to become aware of the situation and were very conscerned for my well being. They flew me back home, where I started going to therapy and was put on medication. All while I started to drink all of the liquor in the house, by myself. I ended up persuading them to let me go back to school for the spring semester. Once I got back to my college apartment it was on. I was using a lot of cocaine and drinking, and eventually tried to off myself. I ended up getting 5150'd in a psych ward for 4 days. From there my parents flew out and got me into a rehabilitation center for 45 days. I moved into sober living after that, but was still miserable. 6 months down the road, I ended up relapsing and eventually smoking meth. \n     This was a big wake up call. I checked myself back into treatment and began working the 12 steps. Right now I'm 5 months sober, I have a full time job, I have a relationship with my family, and am on medication for my depression and anxiety which are both barely visible nowadays. I've put my family through a lot, but I'm grateful to have them in my life today. \n     As for my siblings, they seem to be quite normal so to speak. My sister graduated from high school last year and is backpacking in South America with her boyfriend at the moment before going to college in August. She is going to attend a prestigious university in England. My brother is 15, a varsity athlete and plays drums in two bands. He is also dating a girl in the grade above him. My sister did a bit of partying in high school, but that was just a phase, and my brother is scared to do anything more than smoke weed because of what happened to me. \n     My whole family has a very open and loving relationship. I know I went down the wrong path for a bit. But I wouldn't change any of it for the world. \n     \n", "downs": 0, "stickied": false, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1460917631.0, "ups": 1, "mod_reports": []}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"removal_reason": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DVteCrazy_UVteS-hole", "score": 1, "controversiality": 0, "body": "The answer is in the quotes you added around \"good.\"\n\nMy sibling turned out fine.

I was an extremely self-sufficient little kid, and I was always told that I was the smartest and most mature kid in my grade all the way through elementary school. So by the time I entered middle school I had an ego the size of Texas and refused to ask for help, even when I desperately needed it. This continued all the way through 12th grade.

I guess I was around 3 or something so I don't remember any of that too well. Divorces normally don't go well but it was a lot harder on my sister because she's a few years older. Always had super supportive parents though. I lived with my mom and saw my dad on the weekends while I was growing up. I ended up being a kid who had things come easy so was always in advanced classes and such. Really just for math related courses. My sister didn't have that so she had to work a lot harder for her grades which ended up being way better for her in the long run. By the time I got out of high school I had a full ride to a good college and my sister was close to finishing her nursing degree at the same place. My success didn't last much longer once I got into college though. Classes were still easy at first because they were just basics but I had no work ethic so of course that went south quick. I was with an amazing girl at the time so nothing was wrong in that department. It was really all my fault basically. After the first/second year my grades started dropping and depression started to creep into my life. I smoked a lot of weed but it was really just to pass time at night and make myself feel better. And I worked as a delivery driver at a pizza place so of course I smoked weed. It was basically required to work there. After my second year of college I had about three semesters in a row where I was either failing classes or just straight dropping them and ended up losing my scholarship and stopped going to school. About the same time I ended my relationship with my girlfriend of a little over two years. She was devastated of course. There was never any negativity to our relationship. Sadly my emotions kinda stopped because of the depression and my feelings for her left with it. I still feel bad about that to this day. Then I had about a two month break where I was still working as a pizza driver and was hanging out with friends a lot. My mom had to move out of state for her job so I was living at home alone. Well me slowly becoming a piece of shit I ended up taking a liking to my best friends girlfriend. She broke up with him after a few months of us hanging out together and then started being with me. It was a pretty bad time because it was putting a huge strain on our group of friends and eventually my friend and I stopped talking. Which makes sense. I deserved it. But I loved this girl so much and we were very happy. I still had mild depression, it hadn't got too bad yet, but when I was with her everything was ok. Well we were stupid and guess what; she got pregnant. She moved in with me at my moms house and that's when things really started slipping for me. Eventually of course she had the baby and we were at home taking care of her together. But then my depression got really bad and I started drinking a lot, was taking Xanax a good bit, and just being shit. My girlfriend was basically alone even though we were together and lived together. I became suicidal and attempted that slightly a couple times and then once actually went for it but my friends found out and came to stop me before I went to far. Still have the scars from that one. I made it really hard for a lot of people. Well I tried to make things better but I ended up being bad to my girlfriend. Not violent or anything. I've never been that type of person. But distant and vacant. It was very hard for her at the time and so our daughter stayed with my girlfriends mom for a couple months and then my mom moved back. She took care of our daughter after that for about a month and then we attempted to put her up for adoption but that just caused a huge shit show with my family and eventually we didn't go through with it. I moved out into an apartment with my girlfriend but we really weren't together anymore. Our daughter stayed at home with my mom. Lived there for a year. Guess I should mention I didn't work at a pizza place anymore and actually had a pretty good job working with Apple. I was still depressed but not suicidal anymore. I was able to eventually get to a point where I could shut down my emotions so it wasn't as bad anymore. I didn't feel anything strong anymore. Which was good when it came to sadness but bad when it came to positive things. My ex moved out after some time and after the year lease was up I moved in with some other friends for almost a year. I ended up feeling so much like shit and hating myself that I actually moved back in with my mom. That was actually just at the beginning of this year. I help out now and help with my daughter and am around her a lot more. But I still don't feel any better. I don't tell anyone but I hate my life so much. I don't like being a dad and I don't like living with my mom. All I really want to do is leave and start new somewhere else but I have extreme guilt issues and don't think I ever will. I'm about to start school up again because Apple actually helps pay for it so that's cool but I'm not really all that interested in what I'm doing. I'm just so far in my degree it would be pointless to start something new. And there aren't any schools near me that offer anything I care about. I don't date. I don't think it's worth it anymore. I'm not happy with anything. I don't do any of my old interests. At night I just try to go to a friends house so I can smoke and forget about things for a couple hours. I'm becoming uninterested in my job. I have social anxiety so it's hard for me to be around new people. I don't like what my future will be and I become so jealous when I hear about people at work moving in together or going to enjoy things I can't. I've become numb at this point but I know eventually my depression will start again and idk what will happen then. I have no interest in life but don't want to ruin others by doing anything to myself. I basically just act like I'm ok and do what I have to. But I'm living a life I don't want and feel like an empty shell. Maybe one day things will be better. But when I know I won't enjoy being a parent it's hard to hold hope for a future that forces that. Anyways, that's it for me. It's not the full story of course but who gives a shit. 25 and nothing. \n\nEdit: Forgot to mention. My sister is a successful nurse. She did have a failed marriage but she's doing great now and has found a great guy. I love my sister more than anything as she's always been wonderful to me and I'm glad she has a good life now. She's knows about some of my problems but there isn't much she can do about any of them. I don't talk to my mom about anything. She's never been any help emotionally.

I constantly ask myself this same question and I've never been able to narrow it down as to why I went down the path I did. Why would a smart, upper class kid, with a loving and supportive family turn to drugs? My great grandparents and their parents and their parents were addicts and drunks, maybe that's why? I've never had any real hardship growing up so maybe my lack of coping skills is what made me turn to oxycodone when I was stressed.It could be that I've always had an interest in physiology and how drugs worked on the brain, even before I tried anything, maybe my interest just got the best of me? I'm not a good looking dude I haven't had a relationship in 3 years and I only hook up with girls about every 6 months so maybe it was loneliness that caused it? A year ago when I was only 3 months down this path I asked my friends for help, they berated me and threatened to tell my parents if I didn't get clean, I had to tell them I was to avoid that so maybe its the lack of support that caused me to become addicted.\n\nI think about this all the time and regardless of the reasons it's ultimately my fault. You don't become an addict on accident so it's up to me and me alone to correct my mistakes. No one knows about my addiction and those who did think I'm clean as a whistle so I have to face this challenge alone. Two days ago I told my dealer I'm done and that I won't be contacting him anymore. This is it, if I go back to him then I'm never getting clean, I will be a junkie forever and give up all that life has to offer.

I had a happy childhood. However, now that I'm 20, I'm in a miserable place. I had to leave university (med school) because of bad grades. I'm addicted to alcohol and several kinds of drugs and have financial problems. I live on my own, but I can't take care of myself. I can't even remember the last time I had a normal meal, like bread or potatoes or vegetables. I have no rhythm anymore, I often stay out partying until 7 am and rarely get out of bed  before 4 pm.\n\n\nWhere did it all go wrong? Well my happy family had only 3 major flaws:\nFirstly, my mom was kind of paranoid and overprotective. This caused my siblings and me to hide things and lie to my parents from an early age.\nSecondly, on both my mothers and fathers side I have a lot of relatives with mental ilnesses, addictions, suicides and impulsive behavior in general. I obvliously inherited some of those genes. \nThirdly, my parents really wanted us to go to university aswell. This put a lot of pressure on me and once litterally(i think) one of the main reasons i developped an eating disorder at 14. I was way to secretive for my parents to ever find anything out about it and when my friends finally talked to our councellor, I had become way to good at lying. Therefore I was never really treated for my ED and still struggle with normal eating habits today.\nMy eating disorder gradually caused a depression, my depression caused me to develop an alcohol addiction, drinking alchohol and partying turned me to the drug circuit...\n\nExcept from the controlling behavior of my mom, the bad genes and the high expectations, my family was  the perfect family and I could not have wished for a better one.\n\nAbout my siblings; I have an older brother and a younger sister. My older brother went to university but got terrible grades because he was all night out partying and drinking. He got kicked out of university but is now taking the same classes at a lower level. He still drinks a lot and smokes some weed now and then, but his grades are a lot better.\nMy sister is still in high school. She has had a short period of depression, but got out of that pretty fast. She is no straight A student, but she gets by and is happy.\n\n", "downs": 0, "stickied": false, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1460923872.0, "ups": 1, "mod_reports": []}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
