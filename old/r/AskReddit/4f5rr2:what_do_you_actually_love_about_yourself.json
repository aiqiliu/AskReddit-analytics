From there they will (every man, woman and child love talking about themselves) and it's smooth sailing. Just guide the convo, act interested(eye contact, nodding, all that) and sometimes if they say something you can relate to or chime in on say a bit yourself, and then the convo will either reset to them doing most of the talking or it will be more back and forward. By this point though they'll like you simply because you listen, and they take the good feeling they get from talking about their own interests and associate it with you instead. \n\nThis make you seem to be much attractive. From there you can begin to be much more comfortable with them. A caveat though, unless they full on ask try to keep away from taking huge talks or rants on whatever subject. Like I said before, people love talking about themselves but get annoyed if you begin your own life story or something before they've felt they've fully expressed themselves. \n\nPretty much you let them do the heavy lifting. After they've said everything they wanted to say they might ask you about yourself, and from there be honest. Don't lie extensively, but if there's things you do and like you thinks embarrassing, just leave them as a small footnote or don't bring them up at all. I'd recommend though(depending on what it is, of course) mentioning hobbies that you might be shy or embarrassed about, at least as a small footnote. This way you might find they share your interest and that feeling of relief and connection can drive the interaction home. \n\nAlso, anyone else please let me know if I'm wrong about any of this.
