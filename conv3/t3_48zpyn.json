The wedding was being held at a really fancy hotel, and my parents had booked us rooms there.  When we arrived, my parents were checking in and I saw two women on their way into the lobby from outside, so being a gentleman, I opened the door to let them in.  Turns out, it was Jennifer Love Hewitt and a friend, they were on a shooting break from that movie \"Heartbreakers\", and they were staying at the hotel.  No big deal, really hot celebrity in the hotel, cool for me being a 15 year old boy, but nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nFlash Forward 2 days, my parents have to go help with wedding arrangements, and I'm hanging out at the hotel.  I decide to go get something from the cafe, and since it's just opening for the day, I'm the only one in there.  I'm just getting my food when Jennifer Love Hewitt and her friend come in and sit down a couple of tables away.  I'm trying to eat really cool, acting nonchalant  because I'm a 15 year old boy and that's basically my dream girl sitting a couple of tables away.  All of a sudden, out of nowhere, I hear \"Hey, are you alone?\"  I look up and its Jennifer's friend, she repeats the question, and I tell them that I am, and what my parents are up to.  She tells me to come sit with them, so I very awkwardly do, and they basically just talk about the shoot and the weather.\n\nThroughout the week I end up seeing them at the pool, and just generally around the hotel, and then it comes time for me to leave.  My parents are staying a couple extra days as a little vacation, and I'm going home for school, but when I get to the airport, the flight is overbooked, so they upgrade me to first class since I'm flying alone, and guess who they sit me right next to?  Yep, JLH.  So I spend the flight back chatting with her and her enormous body guard, and he's talking about how he once ate a wheelbarrow full of velveta cheese on a dare.  I get to LAX and get off the plane to go to baggage claim.  I'm standing there waiting for the carousel to start when a woman walks up to me and asks if this is the carousel for flight so and so, and I say it is.  She says she's waiting for her daughters bags, because she has to leave the airport via some special route because she's a celebrity.  Yep, it was her mom.  \n\ntl;dr:  Spent a week hangin' with Jennifer Love Hewitt on Key West, flew home with her and met her mom.\n\nEdit: formatting", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was 15, I was attending a wedding on Key West for a friend of my family.
