Book to movie adaptations in general. \n\nSo for those of you that don't know, Cirque du Freak a movie released a few years back featuring a couple of stars like John C Reilly and Selma Hayek that was based on a book series called The Saga of Darren Shan by author Darren Shan. The premise of the series is a British (or Irish, not really disclosed) teenager is forced to leave his family and friends behind to become a vampire, tutored by his new mentor Larten Crepsley. He is introduced to the world of vampires and Vampaneze, a ruthless variation of vampires that completely drain victims of blood leading to a purple skin tone and more monstrous appearance. He's destined to save the world from a powerful Vampaneze figure, and so must journey throughout the world over countless decades (seeming to be mere years to a reduced aging rate Darren). It was chosen for a movie adaptation, and they butchered it. Of course, Universal first decided it needed to be set in an American high school. Because why not. Then they decided to leave out key moments and characters from the story only to shoehorn in new ones (like a girl with a monkey tail). The casting was bizarre and completely against the character descriptions and illustrations, but by far the worst aspect was the plot. There are 12 Darren Shan novels in total. They are separated into 4 sagas of 3 books, usually representing key times in Darren's adventures with big cliffhangers in the final book of each of the 4 sagas. The movie however, decided \"fuck your character progression, natural tension and plot twist reveal, and let's have the bad guy's identity revealed an hour into the movie instead of the natural point (8 books into the series)\". Even worse, they have the two of them fight, a climactic battle that wasn't meant to occur until the final story, after a multitude of events. The effects look tacky, the characters are portrayed as one dimensional and bland, and the only believable person there is John C Reilly. He does the character justice, but his accent and look don't match the description or illustrations of the character from the books. It was my favourite book series for a while, and my friend and I chose it to be adapted into a film adaptation for our media project, mostly why we got A grades that year. So I was so hyped for this movie when it was announced. And it was so crap. I can honestly say I preferred the Twilight movies to Cirque Du Freak. (Of course, The Saga of Darren Shan is still way better than the Twilight Saga). \n\nIt's pretty much the same story with Stormbreaker to a lesser extent. It's the first in the Alex Rider series, a franchise based around a teenager trained from birth by his secretive MI5 operative uncle (assumed to be a bank manager) to be proficient in numerous covert operative skills and languages, under the guise of \"interesting hobbies and language skills\". Alex is employed by the government to infiltrate a factory planning to produce and freely gift the Stormbreaker, a VR machine with numerous educational subjects, to every school in the country. He is to assume the place of a computer magazine competition winner to gain access to the facility and do typical Bond things to learn what's going on and thwart the bad guys. The author of Alex Rider has also been the one chosen to write the Young Bond books, and I believe also chosen to write new James Bond novels. Anyway. They produced a movie version which was altered in many ways from the book, but turned out alright. It was notably more child friendly than the book suggested a movie would be, but besides that it was okay. If anything I'm just annoyed they didn't continue with the series. Point Blanc has to be one of my favourite books of all time, shame it's never going to see the silver screen.

The casting was bizarre and completely against the character descriptions and illustrations, but by far the worst aspect was the plot. There are 12 Darren Shan novels in total. They are separated into 4 sagas of 3 books, usually representing key times in Darren&amp;#39;s adventures with big cliffhangers in the final book of each of the 4 sagas. The movie however, decided &amp;quot;fuck your character progression, natural tension and plot twist reveal, and let&amp;#39;s have the bad guy&amp;#39;s identity revealed an hour into the movie instead of the natural point (8 books into the series)&amp;quot;. Even worse, they have the two of them fight, a climactic battle that wasn&amp;#39;t meant to occur until the final story, after a multitude of events. The effects look tacky, the characters are portrayed as one dimensional and bland, and the only believable person there is John C Reilly. He does the character justice, but his accent and look don&amp;#39;t match the description or illustrations of the character from the books. It was my favourite book series for a while, and my friend and I chose it to be adapted into a film adaptation for our media project, mostly why we got A grades that year. So I was so hyped for this movie when it was announced. And it was so crap. I can honestly say I preferred the Twilight movies to Cirque Du Freak. (Of course, The Saga of Darren Shan is still way better than the Twilight Saga). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s pretty much the same story with Stormbreaker to a lesser extent. It&amp;#39;s the first in the Alex Rider series, a franchise based around a teenager trained from birth by his secretive MI5 operative uncle (assumed to be a bank manager) to be proficient in numerous covert operative skills and languages, under the guise of &amp;quot;interesting hobbies and language skills&amp;quot;. Alex is employed by the government to infiltrate a factory planning to produce and freely gift the Stormbreaker, a VR machine with numerous educational subjects, to every school in the country. He is to assume the place of a computer magazine competition winner to gain access to the facility and do typical Bond things to learn what&amp;#39;s going on and thwart the bad guys. The author of Alex Rider has also been the one chosen to write the Young Bond books, and I believe also chosen to write new James Bond novels. Anyway. They produced a movie version which was altered in many ways from the book, but turned out alright. It was notably more child friendly than the book suggested a movie would be, but besides that it was okay. If anything I&amp;#39;m just annoyed they didn&amp;#39;t continue with the series. Point Blanc has to be one of my favourite books of all time, shame it&amp;#39;s never going to see the silver screen. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d0o9jim", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1457184559.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1457155759.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_48zmry", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_48zmry", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d0o0pye", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "iteachthereforeiam", "parent_id": "t1_d0nw58j", "score": 45, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Unrelated, but I once had a dream in which I met Sean Penn in a bar, and he was totally convinced that all of his movies were real-life experiences he'd lived through, rather than movies.
