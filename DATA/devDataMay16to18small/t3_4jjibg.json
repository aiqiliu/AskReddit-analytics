I still can't really believe the insanely stupid shit people would do out there, we were constantly having to get on the radio to report people to the closest back country ranger. I have a shit ton of examples, but I'll just list a couple.\n\n1. Ran into a group of about 4 people who were trying to hike to Mt. Whitney and back in two-three days (around 70-80 miles round trip from where they started) and they only brought cliff bars and a space blanket. They ended up getting chased down by the nearby ranger and escorted out of the back country.\n\n2. A group of boy scouts decided they wanted to try to build a raft and started sawing away at young trees. That is suuuuuuper illegal. I think after they were caught they got fined something like $3000 per tree, I can't remember exactly.\n\n3. My boss stumbled upon two hikers who, while fly fishing at night, accidentally hooked a bat and were trying to kill it. My boss ran up to them, chewed them out, and easily unhooked the bat and let it fly off.\n\n4. Caught a couple of douchey \"bros\" trying to feed toothpaste to a bear by hand. I was too confused to be pissed, just told them to cut it out.\n\nThen there are things that might not be common sense, but really piss off rangers and trail workers. \n\n1. Walking slightly off the trail because you don't want to use a step or want to cut switchbacks. Good fucking job asshole, now you're starting a new trail that runs parallel to the preexisting trail. I've personally had to repair a section of trail that had turned into 4 FUCKING TRAILS. Once that happens it is extremely difficult to try and hide/repair the useless new trails.\n\n2. Bears are really good at climbing trees. Do not hang your food from a tree unless you want to be without food and want the bear to be murdered sometime in the future.\n\n3. Don't use soap in lakes or rivers even if it is biodegradable. Biodegradable soap breaks down in SOIL not when it is frothing on the surface of a lake. I've had weekends where I hike 15-20 miles to check out an awesome lake only to discover a giant fucking bubble bath. If you want to use your fancy pants biodegradable soap you need to dig a hole and wash yourself off over it. Or, you know, stop giving a fuck because you're pretty far into the wilderness. It's not like anyone is expecting you to smell like flowers.\n\n4. Speaking of lakes, don't fill your canteen from lakes unless you like having giardia and the sensation of shitting and puking at the same time.\n\n5. Don't be a lazy asshole, dig a proper hole to take a shit in. If it's an emergency you can dig a hole after you shit and scrape the poop into it. DON'T PUT A ROCK ON TOP OF IT. Trail workers frequently build retaining walls, water bars, steps, etc. out of rocks near where they are working. Oftentimes we will spot a rock that would be fucking perfect to plug into the wall we are building only to discover a nice juicy turd splattered all over the underside of it.\n\n6. Don't bitch to rangers and trail workers about mule shit in the middle of the trail or about how the trail workers are \"ruining your wilderness experience\" because you stumbled upon us working and realized that the trail wasn't magically etched into the landscape by little invisible gnomes. Without mules we wouldn't be able to get food and without us you wouldn't even have a fucking trail to hike on.\n\nThere's more stuff I could probably rant about, but those are my main pet peeves.

She refused to believe that we were there in an official capacity, and kept threatening to report us. We offered her our radio if she was really serious, but she still refused to let up until she'd said her piece about us being terrible for being off the trail. When she was done, she returned to the trail in a huff to continue on her way.\n\n* Speeding was a big one. We're talking criminal levels of speeding. This is stupid for a few reasons. For one, there are big animals in the park that don't always stay off the road. For another, National Parks are actually federal land, which means that they are patrolled by federal officers and that your speeding tickets are federally issued. On top of that, if you get pulled over for speeding your name is checked against the national database and you can be arrested for any outstanding warrants from any state.\n\n* My favorite idiot tourist move, though, was the day I watched two tourists pick up pieces of petrified wood (so, rocks) and try their hardest to light them on fire.
