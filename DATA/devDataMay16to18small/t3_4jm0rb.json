I got to the airport later than I would have liked because I had to rely on public transit, and then security took forever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got to the gate with 15 minutes before takeoff. I had my ticket out, and went to board, and they woman at the gate told me that I could not board. I asked why, saying it was still 15 minutes to take off and I had my ticket. By this point, 4 more people had shown up behind me also trying to board.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She said &amp;quot;United policy is to close the gate 10 minutes before take off.&amp;quot; We all looked at the official United clock behind her and pointed out that by her own clock&amp;#39;s count, there was 15 minutes. She wouldn&amp;#39;t look us in the eye, just kept typing at her computer and kept saying matter-of-factly &amp;quot;United policy is to close the gate 15 minutes before take off.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So 5 of us got stranded the Tuesday before Thanksgiving. All they would do is put me on the lowest rung for standby on a flight 5 hours later. No one would accept that they didn&amp;#39;t follow their own policy, despite 5 witnesses calling them on it.
