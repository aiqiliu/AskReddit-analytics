I always saw my primary school experiences as being what toughened me up and set me on a path of never wanting to follow the crowd. It&amp;#39;s partly because I wanted to be different by the time I was in secondary school that I stayed different, but there were quite a few cases where the school hivemind was being homophobic or otherwise immoral and I&amp;#39;m really glad I was in a position to stand my ground, set myself apart from the crowd when I felt they were wrong, and yet lose nothing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically, what I&amp;#39;m saying, is that I liked being the outsider and I&amp;#39;m really glad to identify myself that way. There&amp;#39;s a feeling of strength and freedom to it, and I think it&amp;#39;s good for your character.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have as much fun now as I had then. I overcome most of my mental health problems and now I work as a writer and I have a lot of plans for what I want to do next. I live a pretty full life as far as my MH probs will allow - sometimes I do need to take time out etc. But overall, I&amp;#39;m really glad I was the outcast at school. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d38msbn", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1463510659.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1463481859.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 155, "parent_id": "t3_4joirp", "children": ["d39864h", "d39kjya", "d38q5mr", "d38iwp0", "d38q1ad", "d38aars", "d38hzbf", "d38y4mj", "d38uv2m", "d38kkr6", "d391lat", "d38fifr", "d393uoo", "d393evv", "d38aot9", "d38i881", "d38j6w8", "d39k751", "d38f9i4", "d38xd3b", "d38rmlp", "d38oeal", "d38v41f", "d38hik5", "d395fpy", "d398u9l", "d395a2i", "d38pfq7", "d38kj7h", "d38w7y6", "d38t5xb", "d38m2pu", "d39ufk4", "d390ap1", "d38yhqf", "d38czey", "d38tlqj", "d39hsng", "d38nfpt", "d38wvgy", "d38hpw5", "d38s388", "d38towp", "d38mixm", "d38hx0b", "d3a421p", "d38svha", "d38n80v", "d38hrhk", "d38id0q", "d38s8ku", "d38zh4f", "d38w48g", "d393dwz", "d38osqb", "d38rszc", "d38ukvz", "d38jloe", "d393cyi", "d3931xf", "d38u64k", "d38ptol", "d38mah3", "d38i2yx", "d38ryyt", "d38dci6", "d397wcv", "d38k0i8", "d38th8y", "d38xymx", "d38vee4", "d3975xh", "d38tbj5", "d391m03", "d38x9d1", "d389khd", "d39bxyg", "d38hdih", "d38x8z0", "d38pi26", "d38kgj4", "d38xyuq", "d38twoj", "d38ekdy", "d38cfcn", "d38xz94", "d38zhm5", "d38s62i", "d38u1fl", "d38ro3m", "d38obt7", "d38gq85", "d38kukm", "d389v49", "d38fsu9", "d38jc9a", "d38s89d", "d38qok3", "d38ncgk", "d38xyvi", "d38msf1", "d38q84o", "d38ru1o", "d39evg3", "d38pfxb", "d38jcgx", "d38yfab", "d38j7xh", "d38rlyf", "d3a4t0o", "d38i9k9", "d38s9nx", "d38mq1e", "d397nqm", "d3928rz", "d38klgo", "d38usfy", "d38ivp5", "d38tr7e", "d38zpx8", "d38qdxa", "d38uf2t"], "name": "t1_d39864h", "id": "d39864h"}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
