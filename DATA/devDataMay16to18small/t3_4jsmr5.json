Haven't decided yet. If I got pregnant RIGHT NOW, I would get an abortion - I do not want to deform my body, risk my life, have irreparable damage done to myself for a child I definetly do not want at this moment in time. \n\nI do not know if I would regret aborting in the future. I personally feel that it is much better to regret NOT having children than to regret having children - it's seen as unacceptable to have Byers remorse with kids. \n\nAs far as leaving the kid goes, I wouldn't want that. I wouldn't want to give birth, develop an attachment (wether I want the kid or not, I know I would love it) to it, have it walking around with my genes, having it all warm and tucked up at night and cozy without a mother/second parent. I would be absolutely disturbed at the thought of abandoning the person I gave birth too - not least because of the emotional ramifications but also because of the fact that that is the thing I've pushed out of my vagina and its walking and talking and growing with my DNA. \n\nI wouldn't want that - I would abort rather than leave the child. \n\nIf the other parent really really wanted the kid i t would require strict negotiations with a lawyer. I would want all parental rights terminated - nothing whatsoever to do with the child. No chance of the child ever contacting me - even as an adult. What if, (I am a dance sifter) I decide to have kids in the future? What if this child finds out about me and my hypothetical children and feels unloved and unwanted? How awful would that be? I couldn't risk that. So I would sever all communication with the child. \n\nI would never recover from giving birth to a child I didn't want - even if I never saw said child again.

I would be absolutely disturbed at the thought of abandoning the person I gave birth too - not least because of the emotional ramifications but also because of the fact that that is the thing I&amp;#39;ve pushed out of my vagina and its walking and talking and growing with my DNA. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&amp;#39;t want that - I would abort rather than leave the child. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the other parent really really wanted the kid i t would require strict negotiations with a lawyer.

She&amp;#39;s the funniest girl I know. Now she&amp;#39;s at an age where we can play board games and travel together and hike and have real conversations, and as great as things have been, it gets better every day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had a second daughter late last year. Completely different--I bonded with her so much in utero and I felt that rush of love when she was born. I&amp;#39;m in a much better state, which was instrumental in that. My girls give me so much purpose, I ache to come back to see them when I leave for work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I never thought I&amp;#39;d feel like that. To be honest, if I never had kids, I truly feel I would have been perfectly fine. But having kids really added something completely different.
