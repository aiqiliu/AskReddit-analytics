Kid is the type that doesn't really give a fuck about anything or anyone. Stoner fuck up type, but never a bother to anyone. Cool dude overall, shy and quiet, but oddly very confident, and known to be nice to anyone who ever needed help. Smart, but not at all driven to do any school work or keep good grades. \n\nBig math test. Second period. About 9am. Several pages long. We all knew it was going to be tough and long. Most would never finish in the hour we were given. \n\nThis kid shows up drunk as fuck. Experienced drinker, believe it or not. Could be obliterated and you might not know it. But...you could tell, this morning, he was hammered. \n\nSo there we are, taking this test. I'm sitting right next to him. He reeks of booze. He's got that usual test taking hunched over posture going on. Seems to be focused and dead set on finishing the exam. Doesn't add up. I'm keeping one eye on him. Don't know why.\n\nThen, about 15 minutes into the thing, and without any change to his posture or focus, he does a massive puke all over his exam and the top of his desk. Within a fraction of a second, there is a layer of the stuff all over everything. He doesn't sit up. Doesn't look around. No change in his body position. Almost frozen like but getting the job done. Shows no pain. No fucks given. \n\nHe stays hunched over, focused on his exam. Pencil still upright. He pauses slightly. While still leaning on his left elbow, he uses his right forearm, (think squeegee), to do one perfect sweep of the puke, sending it all the floor and wiping his exam free of nearly every chunk. No slop about it. Just one perfect purposeful clean sweep of the puke. Again, no other indication that he was intoxicated, other than the fact that now more than ever, the smell of hard alcohol was everywhere. \n\nThen with no delay, just continues his work on the exam. Same focus as before. Never bothers to look or and express any other concern. \n\nThe whole classroom just pauses like, we are not surprised, but a little shocked that he has the balls to attempt to pull this off. The teacher is like, WTF. The teacher is thinking...is he just ill and highly focused? Or...no way in hell could a seventh grader be this drunk at this age, this early in the morning, attempting to take a math exam. \n\nWith a very smooth and professional demeanor, the teacher gets up and and helps to escort him to the nurse's office. We all had to clear the room due to the smell and for clean up. Everyone actually stayed really cool about it...oddly, for a bunch of 7th graders. Sort of like, the guy that was not a close friend to anyone, but still a nice guy, is sick and needs help. No story telling and photos and gossip. Sort of like, shell shocked, or the fact that we all oddly felt like we owed him some level of respect to not be a dick and not say anything about it. Just our little math class, second period secret.\n\nHe never again came back to school after this. He just was...gone. And no one ever asked about him and no teacher ever offered an explanation. Maybe we all just knew without really knowing. But I still wonder to this day where he ended up.

Could be obliterated and you might not know it. But...you could tell, this morning, he was hammered. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So there we are, taking this test. I&amp;#39;m sitting right next to him. He reeks of booze. He&amp;#39;s got that usual test taking hunched over posture going on. Seems to be focused and dead set on finishing the exam. Doesn&amp;#39;t add up. I&amp;#39;m keeping one eye on him. Don&amp;#39;t know why.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, about 15 minutes into the thing, and without any change to his posture or focus, he does a massive puke all over his exam and the top of his desk. Within a fraction of a second, there is a layer of the stuff all over everything. He doesn&amp;#39;t sit up. Doesn&amp;#39;t look around. No change in his body position. Almost frozen like but getting the job done. Shows no pain. No fucks given. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He stays hunched over, focused on his exam. Pencil still upright. He pauses slightly. While still leaning on his left elbow, he uses his right forearm, (think squeegee), to do one perfect sweep of the puke, sending it all the floor and wiping his exam free of nearly every chunk. No slop about it. Just one perfect purposeful clean sweep of the puke. Again, no other indication that he was intoxicated, other than the fact that now more than ever, the smell of hard alcohol was everywhere. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then with no delay, just continues his work on the exam. Same focus as before. Never bothers to look or and express any other concern. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The whole classroom just pauses like, we are not surprised, but a little shocked that he has the balls to attempt to pull this off. The teacher is like, WTF. The teacher is thinking...is he just ill and highly focused? Or...no way in hell could a seventh grader be this drunk at this age, this early in the morning, attempting to take a math exam. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With a very smooth and professional demeanor, the teacher gets up and and helps to escort him to the nurse&amp;#39;s office. We all had to clear the room due to the smell and for clean up. Everyone actually stayed really cool about it...oddly, for a bunch of 7th graders. Sort of like, the guy that was not a close friend to anyone, but still a nice guy, is sick and needs help. No story telling and photos and gossip. Sort of like, shell shocked, or the fact that we all oddly felt like we owed him some level of respect to not be a dick and not say anything about it. Just our little math class, second period secret.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He never again came back to school after this. He just was...gone. And no one ever asked about him and no teacher ever offered an explanation. Maybe we all just knew without really knowing. But I still wonder to this day where he ended up. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d370me2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1463393395.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1463364595.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 100}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4ji642", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 2, "parent_id": "t1_d372oqx", "id": "d374plm", "name": "t1_d374plm", "children": ["d374plm"]}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d372oqx", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "lprellwitz1", "parent_id": "t3_4ji642", "score": 21, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "My mother worked with kindergarteners, 1st and 2nd graders.
