Then the creatures cripple me, breaking my arms and legs to the point i cannot move them at all. One of the creatures grabs me by the hair and forcibly holds my head up so that i am forced to look at the bodies of my family and dear friends. A large chorus of the voices of all the dead start singing together, your life is over, your friends are dead, and your family is gone. Live the rest of your life alone next to the corpses of those precious to you. And this is where i always wake up. Nothing ever happens after this. I wake up in a cold sweat, screaming and my brother rushes in to comfort me. This shit is terrifying. Ive had hallucinations (mental issues not drug use) of those faceless creatures before and i couldnt even function. I just shut down right there.
