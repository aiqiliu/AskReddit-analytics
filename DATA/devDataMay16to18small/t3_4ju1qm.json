At this rate, when I go, it probably won&amp;#39;t be due to terrible diabetic complications. &lt;em&gt;But, even so, with an average blood sugar of 170 (which is diabetic) you aren&amp;#39;t going to be dehydrating and peeing constantly. That happens at like 300 and above, so if OP IS feeling bad because of diabetes, the numbers I give would be very useful.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name":

Not to mention that the goals now are not just to be in a field, but everyone wants to &amp;quot;make it big&amp;quot; in their respective fields, which realistically not &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; can do.

Glad to know!**\n\nFor reference I was diagnosed with IBS and haemorrhoids about a year ago. Since then I have sufficiently upped my fiber intake (not metamucil, I just have more veggies, oatmeal, quinoa, stick to olive oil, prunes have become a part of the daily diet, lots of water (I drink about 7-9 litres everyday), have a lot of fruit in the diet, and have completely cut out any refined stuff, i'm looking at you, bread, you evil monster, and deep fried BS post a night out now is also a NO-NO, i go for a single scoop of ice cream instead of a pizza now on late nights.)\n\nFor people who have asked how its going and have recommended some suggestions, I am now devoid of pain when i use the john in the morning. The only instance when it ever causes an issue is when I do heavy drinking late into the night before and do not balance it out with water (hemorrhoid pain + hangover = NO-NO), or have excessively large amounts of meat without balancing it out with veg. Although, in these cases now the pain is very much manageable and wiping after the job is done is not a hellish nightmare anymore. Also, my doctor informed me that losing some weight would help to reduce the stress on the vessels around my anal sphincter, and I am glad I listened to her. The weight loss has significantly improved my comfort levels in the morning.\n\nRegarding the suggestions offered here, all excellent ones, I have put them in a list for IBS/Rhoid sufferers to save you the trouble of going through all the comments,\n\n1. Fiber in the diet - if you are taking metamucil, have copious amounts of water everyday. If not you will get constipated and will be in for even worse hell than you are already in. Other good sources of fiber are whole sprouted beans, carrots, lettuce, celery, cabbage, corn, tomatoes, olives, prunes, dates, basically everything you would find in a green salad.\n\n2. Water - This should really be a no brainer, you must drink a copious amount of water everyday. Not only does it help you stay hydrated, it also makes your stool softer and much easier to pass the next morning.\n\n3. Exercise - I do not exactly know how this helped in my case but it makes the muscles in and around your rectal muscles better conditioned and they relax easily, rather than constricting while you need to pass stool.\n\n4. Probotics - Also a good idea, but beware of the unnatural amount of quite putrid smelling gas you will have after regular use. If you work in a closed office environment, this option is not viable for you, unless you don't mind the stench.\n\n5. Less processed food - Bread and Cheese. Two big baddies, tow things you should avoid if you want to have any peace while passing stool. And while we are at it, if you have IBS, **stay the fuck away** from Mc'Donalds, Wendy's, Subway, Jimmy Johns, Starbucks, Penn Station Subs, In-N-Out, Five Guys, basically any place where the food is excessively processed. Cook your own food at home, sure it may be time consuming and may cost you a little extra in the long run, you will thank yourself later.\n\n6. Less Meat - This one should also be a no brainer. If you know you are in for a meal of only meat (campfires, BBQ pit days, Tailgating events) pre-empt it. Start upping your fiber intake 24 hours earlier. Your system will consequently be thankful to you no matter how much meat you consume. Plus, eating the green leafy vegges is not just for vegetarians anymore, if you have IBS start eating the veggies more and the lean meats more (fish, chicken) and cut out red meat completely (no beef, pork, mutton, lamb **at all**).\n\n7. Using a height differential when you poop (a stool) - Works very well. Forgot to mention that this is how I poop now and it has genuinely been a great help. Not only is it more comfortable, but I also do not find myself straining too hard for the poop to come out.\n\n8. Fiber Pills - Not quite sure how these work, havent taken any myself, but from the comments it seems to be a popular alternative to changing your entire diet. \n\n9. Psyllium Husk - Taken as a supplement with water and has the same effect as metamucil of providing bulk, i.e. insoluble fiber. Works wonders according to comments that people have mentioned below. Definitely worth a shot.\n\n10. The night time itching cure - Apply a coat of Castor Oil. It is a relatively more viscous oil than anything else out there and it coats over the hemorrhoid to give you relief, since it essentially stops the rhoid from rubbing against other skin and prevents any irritation. The bottle of castor oil comes with an applicator and it has always provided me with much needed comfort when most required. Although, the side effect is it does stain any article of clothing which is then impossible to remove, so be prepared to throw away your night clothes and sheets if you are using castor oil.\n\n**EDIT 2 - I have been gilded, do not know what to do with it, but thank you reddit gods.**", "edited": 1463555488.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Irritable Bowel Syndrome/ Haemorrhoids.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ever had a shit that felt like hot lava bubbling out of your ass, coupled with the feeling that you are passing glass shards as well, and are unable to pass gas due to the fear that it will tear your anus?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s exactly what most people suffering from these to conditions feel like.

Not only is it more comfortable, but I also do not find myself straining too hard for the poop to come out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber Pills - Not quite sure how these work, havent taken any myself, but from the comments it seems to be a popular alternative to changing your entire diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psyllium Husk - Taken as a supplement with water and has the same effect as metamucil of providing bulk, i.e. insoluble fiber. Works wonders according to comments that people have mentioned below. Definitely worth a shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The night time itching cure - Apply a coat of Castor Oil. It is a relatively more viscous oil than anything else out there and it coats over the hemorrhoid to give you relief, since it essentially stops the rhoid from rubbing against other skin and prevents any irritation. The bottle of castor oil comes with an applicator and it has always provided me with much needed comfort when most required. Although, the side effect is it does stain any article of clothing which is then impossible to remove, so be prepared to throw away your night clothes and sheets if you are using castor oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT 2 - I have been gilded, do not know what to do with it, but thank you reddit gods.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d39q1hw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1463567662.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1463538862.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3495}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4ju1qm", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4ju1qm", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4ju1qm", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4ju1qm", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 94, "parent_id": "t1_d39vo9k", "children": ["d3acku9", "d39zyf6", "d3a3p9n", "d3a02hi", "d39xi86", "d3a5udk", "d3a1ax6", "d3a1572", "d3a3s7j", "d39xgr4", "d39x34h", "d3aatjm", "d3a26xg", "d3a3lzp", "d39ymja", "d39wil3", "d39w36i", "d39vyu5", "d3a2op1", "d39wp7k", "d3a3yg3", "d3a112e", "d39w5ux", "d3a0rvu", "d39xv3f", "d3a2a3h", "d3a5zsj", "d39wnud", "d39zk1i", "d3a3d8p", "d39x64b", "d3a377j", "d3a6xsg", "d39xs80", "d39w1u1", "d3a3vt6", "d39wy1s", "d39x2aq", "d39y3pq", "d3a24b4", "d3a1brl", "d39yxga", "d3ac0pb", "d3a71i2", "d3a6gyn", "d39vw4g", "d39wqq8", "d39vvqa", "d3a1ip3", "d3a3fu5", "d3a3hwv", "d3a46wg", "d3aih8x", "d39wh9v", "d39w779", "d39zyt2", "d3a1sl5", "d3a15vh", "d39zy5m"], "name": "t1_d3acku9", "id": "d3acku9"}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d39vo9k", "gilded": 1, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "AugerEffect", "parent_id": "t1_d39t0oa", "score": 6113, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Who knew such complex problems could have such basic solutions?

If you log the whole amazon and pave it over, things would still live there, but it &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; wouldn&amp;#39;t be a forest.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d39u36o", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1463574265.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1463545465.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 125}}, {"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 150, "parent_id": "t1_d39nbfy", "id": "d39w1e6", "name": "t1_d39w1e6", "children": ["d39w1e6", "d39xlw0", "d3ah9g1", "d39x3bs", "d39xpui", "d3avbj1", "d3a10rk", "d3a49pd", "d3a57ol", "d3a408j", "d39wv1w", "d3a3xvd", "d3a1kjl", "d3a4soz", "d3a0mkn", "d39uq1e", "d3ahubk", "d3acifr", "d3a4k0o", "d3anw4e", "d3a5mqr", "d39zzol", "d39w0a0", "d3aa356", "d39ufsi", "d39vx4w", "d39rq81", "d39s79e", "d3a5rwy", "d3a7l42", "d3a3q1v", "d3aflv6", "d39wjan", "d39wiwi", "d3a2cac", "d3a4iii", "d39upbv", "d3a9cm8", "d39x32a", "d39viko", "d3a4frf", "d3a61fw", "d39yxu5", "d39s5oz", "d3a30eu", "d3a82jc", "d39xe5g", "d3a0w6f", "d3ar754", "d3ac9v3", "d39y8kw", "d39w8oi", "d3a4kjh", "d39ypzg", "d3a0pvy", "d39zqq9", "d3a4t91", "d3a3192", "d39t7ac", "d39zdbh", "d39vfw9", "d39vj28", "d39yn9l", "d3a279o", "d39un32", "d39ye73", "d3ackmc", "d3a6t7z", "d3a1unp", "d39wl13", "d39y0sh", "d39vxc2", "d39xj0o", "d39ubnu", "d39ws5s", "d3a324y", "d3a3wzg", "d3a52gw", "d39wy4k", "d3a9uw3", "d39rlr7", "d39x3am", "d3a6sxb", "d39v9bl", "d3a2pyw", "d39xzb0"]}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d39nbfy", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "KB84", "parent_id": "t3_4ju1qm", "score": 5338, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Ocean acidification.
