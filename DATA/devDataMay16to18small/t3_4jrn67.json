The woman asked where I was calling from, so of course I told her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Turns out her husband had died of a heart attack in the gym only a few months before, and this was like the THIRD time she&amp;#39;d been contacted by them asking if he wanted to renew his membership...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d38xxeg", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1463530491.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1463501691.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 549}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4jrn67", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4jrn67", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4jrn67", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4jrn67", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 1, "parent_id": "t1_d39jcpl", "children": ["d39kz5h"], "name": "t1_d39kz5h", "id": "d39kz5h"}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d39jcpl", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "youthminister", "parent_id": "t1_d39aw4r", "score": 5, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Good try", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good try&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d39jcpl", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1463558812.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1463530012.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 1, "parent_id": "t1_d39aw4r", "id": "d39d1au", "name": "t1_d39d1au", "children": ["d39d1au"]}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d39aw4r", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ryuzaki49", "parent_id": "t1_d394w47", "score": 30, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Instead of paying debt or reddit gold.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of paying debt or reddit gold.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d39aw4r", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1463546826.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1463518026.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 30}}, {"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 2, "parent_id": "t1_d394w47", "children": ["d39fjlf"], "name": "t1_d39fjlf", "id": "d39fjlf"}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d394w47", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "pursitofHappiness", "parent_id": "t1_d38y2w4", "score": 42, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "oh the joys of using your first paychecks on fun stuff", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;oh the joys of using your first paychecks on fun stuff&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d394w47", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1463539236.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1463510436.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 42}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4jrn67", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d395dr4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "FromTheFieldOfJay", "parent_id": "t1_d38y2w4", "score": 7, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Aah I wasn't entitled to ema.

It was an awful job.\n\nStory 1: Daredevil drop kid\n\nThis did not happen on my shift (I do not run the daredevil drop rotation) Well, Daredevil drop closes earlier than the other rides, we close the part at 6 pm usually, daredevil drop closes at 5pm. Daredevil drop is basically a HUGE straight down slide, like the \"leap of faith\" slide in the Bahamas at Atlantis... But it is 76 feet tall (It is a pain to climb those steps over and over). It was near closing time for the ride and we were letting the last few people go. There was a kid (about 13 years old) who decided that instead of going down the slide normally (lay down, cross feet, arms across chest) he was going to go down head first... Its best described as a slide divebomb (or at least I like to call it that) He gets up out of the normal position and jumps headfirst down the slide, his face hits the slide and he starts tumbling down (keep in mind this is a free fall slide, and if your tumbling your going to bounce and it is highly probable that you are going to break your neck on the slide during the tumble down, or fall off and become a gory puddle.) He miraculously tumbles down the entire slide and the lifeguards were pretty sure he would be dead from such a tumble, but after he came to a sliding halt his limp body suddenly regained its ability to move and he shot up into a sitting position and screamed \" THAT WAS FUCKING AWESOME\" after a quick trip to the medic he was banned from the park.\n\n\nStory 2: Snappy zone\n\n\n[Cyclone zone](https://www.tripadvisor.com/LocationPhotoDirectLink-g60845-d1837436-i41503252-Wet_N_Wild_Emerald_Pointe-Greensboro_North_Carolina.html) is one of the most fun rides that I have ever life guarded, it is fun to pull people out of the current and it is funny to see the little kids scream \"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!\" as they are taken away from their parents by the current and must go around once more. Cyclone zone is not all fun and games though, some serious injuries have happened in the seemingly 'no way to get hurt' ride (according to guests) This may be true for guests, but the same is not so for the lifeguards, There was a girl, I do not know her name, but she was at the stair position of the ride and I was getting ready to leave, the stair position person is suppose to count and then signal when to shut off the engine so the current would slow down, we had put in an extra engine that year so the current was much stronger (2x) than before. One kid decided that he wanted to get out of the ride before they turned off the engines and waited till the current weakened. He grabbed her arm and tried to pull himself out, well, he got dragged by the current and bent her arm against a concrete corner. I heard a crunching sound and then a snapping sound. He smashed the bones in her arm on the concrete and then dislocated it. She started screaming and we shut down the ride and had to pry the fucking brat off because he refused to let go even though he knew, saw, and was even told that it was causing her a tremendous amount of pain and decent physical harm.\n\nStory 3: Lame excuse for running in my river\n\n I enjoyed working the lazy river shift very much because it was usually calm and I could spend time while guarding by thinking or talking to the people riding the ride. But this is also where many  people cause issues. A small child was RUNNING on the bottom of the lazy river, (the reason people are not allowed to walk on the bottom is because sometimes they move fast in the water and people have flipped their tube over on accident and smashed their skulls open on the bottom of the pool before. First off I would rather not jump into the now bloody water to preform a spine extrication and caress your neck and swim softly so as to not damage your possibly damaged spine further, wait for a backboard to show up and extricate you, all while standing in the bloody water. Also many guests will freak out and scramble out of the water and it will be utter chaos.) and I talk to the dad about it since I had already told her multiple times to not do it. this was his response: \"Why don't you just leave her the fuck alone?

It was an awful job.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Story 1: Daredevil drop kid&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This did not happen on my shift (I do not run the daredevil drop rotation) Well, Daredevil drop closes earlier than the other rides, we close the part at 6 pm usually, daredevil drop closes at 5pm. Daredevil drop is basically a HUGE straight down slide, like the &amp;quot;leap of faith&amp;quot; slide in the Bahamas at Atlantis... But it is 76 feet tall (It is a pain to climb those steps over and over). It was near closing time for the ride and we were letting the last few people go. There was a kid (about 13 years old) who decided that instead of going down the slide normally (lay down, cross feet, arms across chest) he was going to go down head first... Its best described as a slide divebomb (or at least I like to call it that) He gets up out of the normal position and jumps headfirst down the slide, his face hits the slide and he starts tumbling down (keep in mind this is a free fall slide, and if your tumbling your going to bounce and it is highly probable that you are going to break your neck on the slide during the tumble down, or fall off and become a gory puddle.) He miraculously tumbles down the entire slide and the lifeguards were pretty sure he would be dead from such a tumble, but after he came to a sliding halt his limp body suddenly regained its ability to move and he shot up into a sitting position and screamed &amp;quot; THAT WAS FUCKING AWESOME&amp;quot; after a quick trip to the medic he was banned from the park.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Story 2: Snappy zone&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.tripadvisor.com/LocationPhotoDirectLink-g60845-d1837436-i41503252-Wet_N_Wild_Emerald_Pointe-Greensboro_North_Carolina.html\"&gt;Cyclone zone&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most fun rides that I have ever life guarded, it is fun to pull people out of the current and it is funny to see the little kids scream &amp;quot;NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!&amp;quot; as they are taken away from their parents by the current and must go around once more. Cyclone zone is not all fun and games though, some serious injuries have happened in the seemingly &amp;#39;no way to get hurt&amp;#39; ride (according to guests) This may be true for guests, but the same is not so for the lifeguards, There was a girl, I do not know her name, but she was at the stair position of the ride and I was getting ready to leave, the stair position person is suppose to count and then signal when to shut off the engine so the current would slow down, we had put in an extra engine that year so the current was much stronger (2x) than before. One kid decided that he wanted to get out of the ride before they turned off the engines and waited till the current weakened. He grabbed her arm and tried to pull himself out, well, he got dragged by the current and bent her arm against a concrete corner. I heard a crunching sound and then a snapping sound. He smashed the bones in her arm on the concrete and then dislocated it. She started screaming and we shut down the ride and had to pry the fucking brat off because he refused to let go even though he knew, saw, and was even told that it was causing her a tremendous amount of pain and decent physical harm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Story 3: Lame excuse for running in my river&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed working the lazy river shift very much because it was usually calm and I could spend time while guarding by thinking or talking to the people riding the ride. But this is also where many  people cause issues. A small child was RUNNING on the bottom of the lazy river, (the reason people are not allowed to walk on the bottom is because sometimes they move fast in the water and people have flipped their tube over on accident and smashed their skulls open on the bottom of the pool before. First off I would rather not jump into the now bloody water to preform a spine extrication and caress your neck and swim softly so as to not damage your possibly damaged spine further, wait for a backboard to show up and extricate you, all while standing in the bloody water. Also many guests will freak out and scramble out of the water and it will be utter chaos.) and I talk to the dad about it since I had already told her multiple times to not do it. this was his response: &amp;quot;Why don&amp;#39;t you just leave her the fuck alone? She can&amp;#39;t use her legs you asshole.&amp;quot; I just kicked him out of the pool along with her. &amp;quot;I AM GOING TO FUCKING SUE YOU! CAN&amp;#39;T YOU SEE SHE CAN NOT WALK!!!??&amp;quot; I turn to her and she is skipping away from the exit as she leaves. No...

A woman and her child came up to me to inform me that this was the child's first time riding down the drop slide, and that the child was nervous. So the mom went first to show the daughter how much fun it was. The mom decided to linger in the middle of the pool, which we did not allow but the guard at the top of the slide didn't seem to care. The child came down the slide, and struggled to reach the surface of the water. So mom goes after the child, and both start struggling. which means I need to jump in and grab the 2 of them. I grab the kid first, and now that mom doesn't need to help her child she happily swims away and says nothing.  \n\nStory 2: Foreign fakers\n\nI grew up in a town not too far from Chicago. Fun fact Chicago has the second largest population of Polish people, only beat by the capitol of Poland. So it's not uncommon to have families come into the pool that don't speak English. I was working a closing shift one night, and this family comes in and begins goofing around on the same drop slides from above. I don't like when people goof around in deep water, so I ask them to cut it out or to get out. The whole time they are pretending not to understand me. Usually we have a Polish speaker on staff, but they were also in the rotation. So no one was able to come and speak to this family, and we were closing in 15 minutes anyways. Well closing time comes around, and in perfect English they tell me to have a good night and thank me for my time. \n\nStory 3: Soap suckers\n\nNot my story, but still happened at my facility. Every so often the guards on break are supposed to roam the locker rooms. This way we can keep horse play to a minimum, prevent theft from lockers, or any vandalism, etc. Well one afternoon one of our male guards had the pleasure of stopping a soap eating contest between 2 brothers. We brought them into our office, and called their parents. Just long enough for one of the brothers to decide to puke up soap all over our office. \n\nStory 4: Poop parade\n\nAgain not my story, but too *juicy* not to share. Every day we had camps spend the afternoon at the pool. On one particular afternoon we had a camper run to the bathroom a few times. The camp counselors failed to notice. So the child then wanders to find a counselor, and then to find his towel, and then to our office for help - all the while leaving a nice brown liquid shit trail behind him. Our manager wrapped the child in a black trash bag from the waist down, until a camp counselor could be bothered to look for the child. \n\nI have more, but I think these are my top 4.

Along with that, I could workout as much as I wanted, play on my computer as I &amp;#39;worked&amp;#39; and I didn&amp;#39;t have to drive from work to class because my classes were all 20 ft away from the gym.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only downside was pay was minimum.  Once my hours started getting cut because they brought in someone else, I quit after working there for 2 years.   &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d3995sz", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1463544605.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1463515805.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 20}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4jrn67", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4jrn67", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 1, "parent_id": "t1_d39hm90", "children": ["d39mji6"], "name": "t1_d39mji6", "id": "d39mji6"}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d39hm90", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "WYRFORA", "parent_id": "t1_d390g4c", "score": 10, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "People hate on delivery drivers but when I did it I thought it was great.

We did a little bit of everything as a computer shop. We would build custom computers, virus/malware removal, networking, and lots of other things such as help out other small businesses. The old man who owned the shop would pretty much just talk to customers and his business partners all day while me and my older coworker Jeff did the work. \n\nIt was a pretty laid back and a fun job. I really enjoyed it until the owner's son got back into town. The owner's son was in his 40s but you could tell he was used to mooching off his dad. I remember multiple times him coming into the shop and taking cash directly out of the cash drawer. \n\nI asked the old man what we should do and he just kind of shrugged. Looking back on it I kind of feel bad for his son. He had gone through the war in Iraq and had lost a lot of his platoon due to road side bombs. He also had a horrible alcoholism that ruined his marriage and any job he hoped of finding after the military. \n\nOne funny story I remember was the son would \"help\" us with fixing the computers. One day Jeff and I thought it would be funny to have our own fun.

We did a little bit of everything as a computer shop. We would build custom computers, virus/malware removal, networking, and lots of other things such as help out other small businesses. The old man who owned the shop would pretty much just talk to customers and his business partners all day while me and my older coworker Jeff did the work. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a pretty laid back and a fun job. I really enjoyed it until the owner&amp;#39;s son got back into town. The owner&amp;#39;s son was in his 40s but you could tell he was used to mooching off his dad. I remember multiple times him coming into the shop and taking cash directly out of the cash drawer. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I asked the old man what we should do and he just kind of shrugged. Looking back on it I kind of feel bad for his son. He had gone through the war in Iraq and had lost a lot of his platoon due to road side bombs. He also had a horrible alcoholism that ruined his marriage and any job he hoped of finding after the military. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One funny story I remember was the son would &amp;quot;help&amp;quot; us with fixing the computers.
