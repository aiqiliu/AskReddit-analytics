There are plenty of perfectly good reasons to complain about the TSA (Though most people fail to draw the distinction between the floor workers and the management, which do not see eye to eye on almost anything), so we were pretty used to hearing people venting about various things, almost none of which were in our control. With \"person who tolerates you because there's no other option\" as the baseline, our extreme complainers were a thing to behold. My favorites, in no particular order:\n\n\n- A woman, perhaps in her 60s, hollering that the x-ray machines are fake, and we keep midgets in the metal boxes of the machines, who quickly go through each person's bag to steal their money.\n\n\n- Another woman, in tears and loudly bemoaning the injustice, because I wouldn't allow her to take her son's paintball gun as a carry-on. She carried on this wailing, along with a series of insults about how useless I was, for the entire time while I carried her bags for her and personally escorted her to the ticket counter of her airline to check her bag and ensure she still reached her flight on time.\n\n\n- Numerous passengers who would scream in the middle of the checkpoint \"Water's not a liquid!\" or \"That's not a liquid, that's water!\" when informed they couldn't bring a water bottle through. Yeah, the rule is stupid, but not as stupid as they are...\n\n\n- I, thankfully, was never physically assaulted by a passenger, but one of my friends and colleagues quit after being attacked twice in a year. She was a soft-spoken and sweet young woman, about 5'4\" on a good day, and at the time of the second attack she was around 7 months pregnant. What set it off was her suggesting to a man with an enormous metal belt buckle that had just set off the metal detector that he should send it through the x-ray machine.

There are plenty of perfectly good reasons to complain about the TSA (Though most people fail to draw the distinction between the floor workers and the management, which do not see eye to eye on almost anything), so we were pretty used to hearing people venting about various things, almost none of which were in our control. With &amp;quot;person who tolerates you because there&amp;#39;s no other option&amp;quot; as the baseline, our extreme complainers were a thing to behold. My favorites, in no particular order:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A woman, perhaps in her 60s, hollering that the x-ray machines are fake, and we keep midgets in the metal boxes of the machines, who quickly go through each person&amp;#39;s bag to steal their money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another woman, in tears and loudly bemoaning the injustice, because I wouldn&amp;#39;t allow her to take her son&amp;#39;s paintball gun as a carry-on.
