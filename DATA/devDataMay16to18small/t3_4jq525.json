The relationship between coefficient of lift and angle of attack varies heavily with the shape of the airfoil, and also the Reynolds number at which the forces are measured. Certain airfoils are designed to be more efficient in the transonic/supersonic conditions, while others are designed with subsonic flight in mind. \n\nA lot of false theories about lift in particular come from the fact that people often try to simplify a very, very complex system with simple explanations. There's no simple explanation for how lift is generated, nor is there a simple explanation for why the different characteristics of a wing affect lift in the way that they do. For the most part, we can easily make claims about trends. For example, increasing angle of attack will cause the coefficient of lift to increase up until the critical angle of attack (think wing stall), but the actual aerodynamics behind (why it happens) has no easy-to-understand explanation. \n\nSource: Aero engineer, had to analyze/model aerodynamic trends for work", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure what you&amp;#39;re trying to say here, but it sounds like you&amp;#39;re implying that the majority of the lift force is generated by the momentum imparted by the air onto the lower surface of the wing. This is yet another one of those false theories about lift that&amp;#39;s propagated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/wrong2.html\"&gt;https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/wrong2.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a lot of complexities in the aerodynamics involved between the shape of an airfoil and the amount of lift generated in similar conditions. The relationship between coefficient of lift and angle of attack varies heavily with the shape of the airfoil, and also the Reynolds number at which the forces are measured. Certain airfoils are designed to be more efficient in the transonic/supersonic conditions, while others are designed with subsonic flight in mind. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A lot of false theories about lift in particular come from the fact that people often try to simplify a very, very complex system with simple explanations. There&amp;#39;s no simple explanation for how lift is generated, nor is there a simple explanation for why the different characteristics of a wing affect lift in the way that they do.
