He taught me to take responsibility for my actions, to be generous, to tell those you love that you love them early and often. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He sang in the kitchen on Saturday mornings and made us breakfast. He read to us at bedtime. He played pranks on us and told absolutely ridiculous jokes and loved to laugh. He took us fishing and showed up for silly school plays. When I taught swim lessons- I caught him standing with the parents of the toddlers in my class beaming at me. He timed my races at swim meets and told me how good I did and told me when I needed to improve. When I started college he would get so excited to talk about what I learned. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He wasn&amp;#39;t perfect, and he was a single parent raising two little girls alone for a long time- he had work trips and late nights and didn&amp;#39;t manage to cook very often.
