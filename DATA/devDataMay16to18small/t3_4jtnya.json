I later asked him if he&amp;#39;d used it, he said &amp;quot;not so much, coffee is expensive! I&amp;#39;ll go broke buying it!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went to visit him a couple of weeks after he moved in. Remember above how I said he was causing us to use a roll of toilet paper per day? When he moved in, he bought a 24 pack of toilet paper. I used his bathroom and noticed that he still had the same pack, and only &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; rolls had been used had been used for that two week period. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: One point I&amp;#39;d like to clarify. He wasn&amp;#39;t fleeing a war-torn country without a nickel to his name or anything like that. I had to work as his agent for a few weeks before he arrived. I handled his bank statements and identity documents to get things ready for his arrival; dude had money. Rather, his family had money. His personal bank account had $50,000 in it, with regular deposits from (presumably) his mom.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d3agc87", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1463620860.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1463592060.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4jtnya", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4jtnya", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4jtnya", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d39l4db", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ali5005", "parent_id": "t1_d39k5zw", "score": 5, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Cheap, I have seen this guy haggle with a 12 year old kid about 1 euro over a video game.

It was my ex girlfriend's BFF. The daughter of a very big and successful real estate broker, a millionaire. They lived in a massive house, when that girl turned 21 they booked a pretty famous national DJ for the party of 200+ people and she got a brand new Mini Cooper S, the most expensive, full-option type available. That family swam in money. But that daughter, my ex's BFF, and her boyfriend were cheap beyond belief. Even though I had a simple job and didn't earn that much at the time, never was I a cheapskate, on the contrary. That couple and that girl in particular pissed me off many times.\n\n* Once we went to a movie with the 4 of us and decided to eat in somewhere after the movie. We had all had the same food and drinks and when the bill came the total sum was something about \u20ac92-ish, say \u20ac46 per couple. Here in the Netherlands tips aren't included but it's common to give something yourself if the food and service were good. I paid for my ex and myself and added a little tip, casually putting a \u20ac50 bill on the table. Rather than adding their \u20ac42, they used my \u20ac4 tip and put only an additional \u20ac38 on the table, practically using my tip to pay for their share and rounding up to the exact amount on the bill.\n\n* If we'd go out with a group we'd always have the guys and girls separated and in each group take turns in getting something to drink (the guys drank a lot more beer than the girls did wine, hence the separation). Whenever it was one of that couple's turn to get the drinks for the group, they'd always mysteriously disappear (toilet, making an 'important call' outside, etc). Once everyone started paying attention to it it quickly appeared they never got drinks, until we explicitly waited for them and told them to do so.\n\n* Occasionally the 4 of us would just stay at home and watch a movie. The couple that visited generally brought along some drinkt and snacks with them. When we would visit them, we'd always bring plenty of supplies. A bottle of Coca Cola, a few bags of chips. It was always to many and there'd be stuff left over. But if they would visit us, they'd bring the tiniest bag of M&amp;Ms or the cheapest bottle of coke they could find. The worst thing is, they always behaved like swines and ate and drank pretty much everything the minute you put it on the table.\n\n* Designated driving. We all liked our alcoholic beverages so we agreed in taking turns for designated driving. And if I'd have to drive 2 or 3 or times in a row, I wouldn't mind. At one point they were long overdue for their turn and I already had been designated driver for the last 5 times or so, so I insisted that they would drive and pick us up. They couldn't. When I asked them why, they replied that they were both out of fuel. \"So? Go to a gas station...\" I replied, to which they replied that the fuel prices were expensive at that time and that they wanted to wait for them to decrease for a few more days...\n\nI never really liked them to begin with; mostly hang around with them because that girl was my ex's BFF. I was so glad when they broke up and that ended. That was over 7 years ago. I recently ran into that girl; she now has a store with home decoration items in a monumental \u20ac300K estate daddy just bought for her like that as an investment.

They lived in a massive house, when that girl turned 21 they booked a pretty famous national DJ for the party of 200+ people and she got a brand new Mini Cooper S, the most expensive, full-option type available. That family swam in money. But that daughter, my ex&amp;#39;s BFF, and her boyfriend were cheap beyond belief.
