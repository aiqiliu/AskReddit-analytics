We find in our solar system a hub of sorts, with FTL shuttles to other hubs with more shuttles, or space stations or worlds, etc.  It appears that the system is abandoned, but still mostly works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, we haven&amp;#39;t deciphered the destinations yet, and &amp;quot;mostly&amp;quot; works is also risky.  Nevertheless, there is also the possibility of coming back with some bit of alien tech that can be reverse engineered and make you rich.  So, folks start lining up as volunteers to take a chance on a shuttle, risking their lives to go into the unknown for a shot at hitting it big.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tons of stories possible, would love to see it as a series.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d38i7t1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1463494432.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1463465632.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4jnwgj", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d385d49", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "JustJivin", "parent_id": "t3_4jnwgj", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Michael Crichton's *Prey*", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Crichton&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Prey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d385d49", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1463471455.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1463442655.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4jnwgj", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4jnwgj", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d3880ek", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MrDNL", "parent_id": "t1_d3872ac", "score": 7, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I really wish they had made Thrawn Trilogy movies.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really wish they had made Thrawn Trilogy movies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d3880ek", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1463475540.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1463446740.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4jnwgj", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4jnwgj", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d38ih7t", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "josef_hotpocket", "parent_id": "t1_d3886te", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Karen Traviss is a terrific author.
