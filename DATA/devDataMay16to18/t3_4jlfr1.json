While slavery as a system is not protected by Capitalism and is, as you said, the antithesis of what Capitalism represents, this need for lower wages to keep profits high will often lead to slavery, which is obviously not part of Capitalism but is undeniably often seen in Capitalist systems. In fact, slavery cannot exist under Communism, as Communism calls for a stateless, classless, and most importantly moneyless society. Without money, and without private bourgeois ownership over the means of production, your living conditions are not decided by private interests. Labor is done out of both enjoyment of work and, more commonly, skills only obtained by a handful of people, who would see execution of said skills, regardless of personal enjoyment (which could be present, however), as their duty. This system renders slavery impossible, in the sense that slavery is rewardless labor in a system where labor is supposed to correlate with rewards.\n\nNow, about imperialism. You're right, imperialism is a system of government, but, as with slavery, the environment for imperialism to develop is almost exclusively seen in a Capitalist nation/society (the exception being, in my opinion, Trotskyism, which, while socialist, can lead to imperialism as well.) Capitalism rewards greed, while Communism attempts to stifle it. Imperialism, which includes the use of cheap foreign labor made cheap through oppressive colonialism, is a greedy way of doing things. If Capitalism rewards the private owners of the mean of production for their greed, then imperialism would do nothing but raise the income of the bourgeois.\n\nNow on to poverty. There is no denying that living conditions have improved for many people, but you have to recognize that Capitalism CANNOT WORK without class hierarchies. This isn't an opinion, this is a fact. Monetary rewards do not always correlate with effort. A factory worker will always be paid less than a factory owner, even though an argument could easily be made claiming the workers job is more difficult, therefore theoretically deserving of a bigger paycheck. The poor will always exist under capitalism, and because of the need for laborers willing to work for low wages, their paychecks will never truly rival those of the bourgeois class. A person born in a poor family will most likely stay poor, as economic upwards mobility is pretty much a myth. Because of lower quality education seen in poorer neighborhoods, and growing up surrounded by people accustomed to shitty living conditions, most poor people will not meet the requirements needed to work high paying jobs, starting the cycle of looking for and working a job that pays anything, just to survive. Now, there will always be outliers. Poor people who make it out of the vicious cycle, and rich people who lose their fortunes, but the fact that these are outliers and not common shows that Capitalism in practice freezes class movement. Inheritance is an example of something that keeps the bourgeois from falling into the working class, as people, regardless of work ethic, who were born to a rich family will often receive and undeserved head start through inheritance or familial loans. A slave works hard laborious jobs for no reward and is forced to live in squalor. A wage laborer works hard laborious jobs for a miniscule reward that causes them to only be able to afford to live in squalor. Is there really that much of a difference, aside from being able to chose your master? So yeah, living conditions have improved, but they are not equal across the board as I believe they should be.\n\nYour homelessness argument is idiotic. Homelessness is not a natural state of humans, AT ALL. A house shouldn't be a reward, it should be a nessecity. While I do not agree with all of their politics, look at Cuba.
