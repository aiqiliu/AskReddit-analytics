It also promises an afterlife that distracts people from trying to make this world the best it can be. There is a high incident rate of believing in mysticism and disbelieving in science. The psychological effects of religious indoctrination from a variety of faiths are also very damaging and not readily apparent, although you only have to ask apostates like me if they still deal with issues because of the bullshit I was taught to hate about myself since I was a child. Or the amount of rifts in families because of religion. My parents love me but we have a strained and distant relationship because they always bring everything back to God and it doesn't help me. They think I'm going to hell so it pains them too. This can't be measured, but it's hardly outside the norm.\n\nReligion is not a 100% force of evil, but the charitable acts some make in its name doesn't even begin to touch the damage its done.
