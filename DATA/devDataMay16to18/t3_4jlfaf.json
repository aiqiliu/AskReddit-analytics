I\u2019ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I\u2019ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I\u2019m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You\u2019re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that\u2019s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little \u201cclever\u201d comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn\u2019t, you didn\u2019t, and now you\u2019re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You\u2019re fucking dead, kiddo.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d37k838", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1463441142.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1463412342.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4jlfaf", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d37klio", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "candlecrusher", "parent_id": "t1_d37j74e", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "You're so soft you may as well be a furby blanket.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re so soft you may as well be a furby blanket.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d37klio", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1463441686.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1463412886.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d37j74e", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ALLSTARTRIPOD", "parent_id": "t1_d37i6ay", "score": 8, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yeah well you look like a furby.

Add a+b+c+d together and if that number can be divided by 3, the number abcd can be divided by 3.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So for example take 1352. 1+3+5+2=11. 11 cannot be divided by 3 so 1352 is not dividable by 3. However lets use 3141. 3+1+4+1=9. 3 divides 9 nicely. Therefore you can divide 3141 by 3.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any number ending in 5 or 0 can be divided by 5, and any number ending in 0 can be divided by 10&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any even number can be divided by 2 ofc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How does this help? Through factors thanks to a property in math known as commutativity. Basically it means you if you have a bunch of numbers to multiply in a row (a&lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;c) you can multiply them in whatever way you want and it doesnt fucking matter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So how is this useful? if you have something like 162/18, you can use these test to simplify it out. 162 is divisible by 9 according to our rules as 1+6+2, and thus i divide by 3 in my head twice and get 54/6. Then its just 9.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This makes sense to me. Dont know if it does to you. Math people are generally truly awful at explaining math unfortunately :(&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ps: I do enjoy literature but dont have the best musical ear. Its slightly above average thanks to early musical lessons from my parents, but not anything even good.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d37pd1d", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1463448534.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1463419734.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d37oh4e", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "number9muses", "parent_id": "t1_d37o7ed", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": ":/ yeah I guess.
