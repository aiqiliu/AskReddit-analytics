There was a soothing and calming feeling every time I seen her. Her smile would shine through the darkened lab that she was working in, and would easily move through the cramped spaces, and her athletic yet petite frame was something I haven't seen at the time.\n\nI moved around seats to observe what she was up to. One day the science teacher introduced her, and let us know what she was working on her science project and would remind us to get ours done to go down to the science fair in the bigger city. It was at that point, I knew I had to get one rolling, I felt I could impress her with my scientific prowess and talk with her, and maybe ask her out. I really don't remember what I did as a project, but from the time I first seen her to the time we got on the bus to head south, I knew my chance was waiting.\n\nThe science fair was a weekend affair, it went from Thursday to Saturday, all categories were being judged on Friday, there was a variety of colleges there for recruitment, I went up to some BS'd, and walked around after I spoke with judges about my project. Through the days we were there, I managed to talk with her a few times, I had more butterflies being around here than talking with the judges. As much as she seemed out of place, she was very relaxed, had an infectious laughter, smiled a lot, and didn't mind talking with me about music, movies, books, and stuff going on in our area.\n\nDuring the awards ceremony, we both walked away first place in our respective categories, which was great because I winged my project. After the ceremony, we boarded the bus, went out to eat, walked around the mall, and by the time we left the city; the sun was setting. The ride was 2 hours north of the city. Around 45 mins back, the drone of the bus engine put everyone to sleep, except her and I. We sat in the back in our own seats, and talked and talked. What always stands out were the albums she really enjoyed listening to, and that was A Perfect Circle \"Mer de Noms\", and Deftones \"The White Pony\". Those albums were on regular rotation in my CD player. I sat there in shock, if I remember correctly, she really enjoyed: \"The Hollow\", \"Judith\", and \"3 Libras\" from APC, and \"Digital Bath\", \"Passenger\", and \"Pink Maggit\" from the Deftones.\n\nIt was at that point, I started humming those songs as best as I could remember, I don't have a good singing voice, so I hummed it to her in the range I knew the songs. She giggled, and there was a tenderness when she would start talking. In all the dark, among sleepy riders, the passing headlights from the highway lit up the interior of the bus, and she was the only I seen, and I hoped that I was the only she seen too. The ride back all in itself was more bliss than I could ever imagine. There was two strangers that boarded a bus, and in that moment, we became entwined souls. When we arrived to our final destination at the high school, it was shrouded in darkness, and only the incandescent lighting fended the dimness our paths. Her spirit was brighter than any star that I could pick out in that winter night.\n\nNot long after we arrived, she was picked up, she smiled, waved, and went on her way. I waited for my ride, it came and I went home. After the science fairs were done, she no longer came around, and when I moved up a year into my freshman year in HS, she was busy with sports, academics, and her own life. Although, she would stop by to talk for a bit, smile, and be on her way again. I never felt hurt by the small conversations, we had our flash connectivity, and we went about with our own lives. It was something I accepted, but I'll admit I re-live that moment when I hear those songs.\n\nFor a while, I often felt that attachment spoiled any future relationships I had, I unfairly compared her to the others that made a connection with me. I know there will be no one like her, and it took some time for me to separate my ideals from the genuine women I meet. I looked her up on FB one time, I seen that she got married, I'm happy for her. I'm single and enjoy meeting people when I can.

I&amp;#39;m assuming she had a an hour of being an office aide, so she would come to my science class before lunch, and do her experiments for science fair. I think I was the only dude in my class that was paying attention to her, in a certain light and a flick of of her shoulder length brown hair; it all hit me like a freight train.
