I learned my lesson and got clean.\n\nLong version: Back when I used to be addicted to opiates, there was one day I couldn't get my usual stuff so my guy brought me Tramadol. These painkillers were manufactured to be difficult to abuse, and after a few pills I didn't feel anything, so I took some more. One minute I was sitting on the couch with my friend watching TV, feeling great, and the next minute I open my eyes to find myself covered in blood. My friend, her dad, and my mom were all staring at me in shock. Turns out I blacked out and had a seizure that lasted at least ten minutes (by their estimates), during which bit right through my tongue. During that time - this is according to them - I wasn't breathing, just making these awful choking noises with blood and foam pouring out of my mouth. They thought I was dying, and in retrospect, I don't know how I survived. Brain damage begins after just four minutes without oxygen.\n\nThere was some neurological damage, of course. I lost memories and it feels like chunks of my life are missing. I've also developed a mild speech impediment where my words sometimes come out kinda gargled (imagine trying to talk with cottonballs in your mouth) and I occasionally stutter, but it's only really noticeable if I'm speaking too quickly to enunciate every syllable. There's some bad scar tissue on my tongue, but it's not something you'd see if you weren't looking for it.\n\nUltimately, I got lucky. I can't believe it. My brain was starved of oxygen for so long that I should have died, or at least ended up with severe, permanent brain damage. There is no scientific explanation for my survival as far as I know. All I know is, I learned my lesson. I've stopped taking opiates entirely, and have been clean off of them for over a year now. Weed is all I need these days.\n\nALSO, to anyone who is currently addicted to opiates and wants to get clean - I have complete faith in you. I won't lie to you and say it's easy. In fact, it might be the hardest battle of your life, but it's so worth it. Whether you believe it or not, you're worth fighting for.

I learned my lesson and got clean.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Long version: Back when I used to be addicted to opiates, there was one day I couldn&amp;#39;t get my usual stuff so my guy brought me Tramadol. These painkillers were manufactured to be difficult to abuse, and after a few pills I didn&amp;#39;t feel anything, so I took some more. One minute I was sitting on the couch with my friend watching TV, feeling great, and the next minute I open my eyes to find myself covered in blood. My friend, her dad, and my mom were all staring at me in shock. Turns out I blacked out and had a seizure that lasted at least ten minutes (by their estimates), during which bit right through my tongue. During that time - this is according to them - I wasn&amp;#39;t breathing, just making these awful choking noises with blood and foam pouring out of my mouth. They thought I was dying, and in retrospect, I don&amp;#39;t know how I survived. Brain damage begins after just four minutes without oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was some neurological damage, of course. I lost memories and it feels like chunks of my life are missing. I&amp;#39;ve also developed a mild speech impediment where my words sometimes come out kinda gargled (imagine trying to talk with cottonballs in your mouth) and I occasionally stutter, but it&amp;#39;s only really noticeable if I&amp;#39;m speaking too quickly to enunciate every syllable. There&amp;#39;s some bad scar tissue on my tongue, but it&amp;#39;s not something you&amp;#39;d see if you weren&amp;#39;t looking for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I got lucky. I can&amp;#39;t believe it. My brain was starved of oxygen for so long that I should have died, or at least ended up with severe, permanent brain damage. There is no scientific explanation for my survival as far as I know. All I know is, I learned my lesson. I&amp;#39;ve stopped taking opiates entirely, and have been clean off of them for over a year now. Weed is all I need these days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ALSO, to anyone who is currently addicted to opiates and wants to get clean - I have complete faith in you.
