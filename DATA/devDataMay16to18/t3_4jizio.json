If you want to get started and don't want to learn chinese and japanese so you can read books that were written hundreds of years ago i recommend listening to Alan Watts seminars. He is one of the few people who brought zed philosophy to the west and most of his seminars are archived. One of the biggest keys to understanding what zen is about is to realise that you are not separate from the rest of the universe and that everything you do is simply an expression of the universe and not a separate action. Once you understand this you will never look at the world the same way again. Like everything else in the world this is not for everyone but if you like to think and want to experience life in a completely different way, this is a good place to start.\n\n[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD2NWl6C05o) is one of my personal favorites.

If you want to get started and don&amp;#39;t want to learn chinese and japanese so you can read books that were written hundreds of years ago i recommend listening to Alan Watts seminars. He is one of the few people who brought zed philosophy to the west and most of his seminars are archived. One of the biggest keys to understanding what zen is about is to realise that you are not separate from the rest of the universe and that everything you do is simply an expression of the universe and not a separate action.
