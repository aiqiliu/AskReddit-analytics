You were jumping, and another person was jumping with you, slightly ahead of you, as a tutorial like thing.  After a while you pass them slowly, and after few minutes they disappear and you&amp;#39;re left to jump alone.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then you start playing on a swing, and a girl sits beside you, and you both swing higher and higher until you jump off, and she doesn&amp;#39;t follow. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then you get a dog.  You play, picking stuff up with them a while and get get older and older and can&amp;#39;t keep up, so you slow down.  Then they lie down, and don&amp;#39;t get back up.  It then cuts to their grave.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You are left alone, to pick stuff up swing and jump.  As you complete the level their ghosts slowly appear mirroring what you&amp;#39;re doing to show they are still with you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I dunno it really moved me at the time.  with all the talk about Journeys friend system, and the moments people had, and a bunch of other talk about death in games I always wanted to find it again to see of I still felt it was cool.
