It gets to be about 11:45 at night, and the last train goes roaring by a few hundred feet away. \"Welp,\" she says, \"looks like I might have to stay the night here,\" and I say that it's fine, and I also take that as a cue to get ready for bed.\n\nSeeing as how I didn't actually have a bed then, just an awesome dark green leather couch and matching loveseat that's comfy as hell (and that I honestly miss, curse my fucking bed for being dumb), I push the couch and loveseat together to make most of a bed, and it works out. Andrea just starts stripping in front of me down to her underwear while I change into my pajamas. She looks over at me, \"why are you sleeping with clothes on? That's weird as hell.\" It's not weird, I thought, it's me being decent cause no one wants to see me naked.\n\nI climb into the combined couch pod that I made, and she comes too. I gently direct her into the love seat seeing as how she's shorter than me and doesn't need all the space, and I roll over facing the back of the couch, away from her, and I pass right the hell out.\n\nI couldn't have been asleep for any more than like ten minutes cause she must have moved or rolled over in her sleep, cause now her leg was thrown over my body, and one of her arms was wrapped over me, as if I was the little spoon. I couldn't be the little spoon, cause she was just a friend and we really don't cuddle.\n\nBut then her lips were resting on the back of my neck, and I'm not sure, but I think she was kissing me in her sleep. I laid perfectly still so as not to be a weirdo just cause she moves around in her sleep. I didn't do a single anything, cause I didn't want Andrea to think I'm a creep.\n\nSomehow I wake up in the morning flipped over and facing her, and the first thing I see is her chest, seeing as how she took off her bra and my head got moved down in my sleep. I take a moment to realize what I'm looking at, then I slap my hand over my eyes. Andrea kisses the back of my hand and pulls it away. There's naked boobs right there. I guess she got hot and took off her underwear in her sleep. I didn't know why I wasn't hot, I was still wearing pajamas and had two blankets going on, and it felt good. Also January. My thought process just woke up, it wasn't the best.\n\nAndrea starts kissing down my neck, and she says that it's okay I don't feel the same about her, that I'll always be her adorable little cutie. I reply back that I do feel the same about her, and we're amazing friends cause we're awesome together.\n\nShe smirks and gets her clothes back on and heads out, and since then I've only seen her on facebook, cause we're still friends there.\n\nSo that was six years ago, and a week ago I just realized that she wanted us both to sleep naked, that she never actually fell asleep, that the cuddling was on purpose, and that she wanted to date me.\n\nAnd I told her about my epiphany, and she said that she was at least glad she got to cuddle me.
