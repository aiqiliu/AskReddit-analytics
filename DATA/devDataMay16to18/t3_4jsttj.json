Im going to give you my take on what transpired with you in the hope that it might make you feel better about your current situation and to enlighten you so that your future encounters with females will go a little more smoothly. \n\nFirst, let's go over how you described this girl. According to you she sounds relatively smart (you mentioned lab so I take it that you're both STEM majors), good looking, charming (she showed interest in your hobbies despite not doing any of them), ambitious (trying to balance a job and finals), and confident (SHE approached YOU for help). Now you're a guy who sounds kind, helpful, and probably a bit on the nerdy side (don't be offended but you're on Reddit expressing grievances over a girl - I've done similar things so real recognize real here). From the get-go you guys don't sound like a realistic match, but let's dig deeper and figure out what went wrong. \n\nIt sounds like she genuinely needed help on her schoolwork and saw you as someone who could assist her. You should be flattered by this because not only did another person consider you smart, but also kind and helpful. This fact shouldn't be lost on you despite how hurt or confused you might be feeling right now. However you might be thinking to yourself \"well that's great and all stranger, but I put in time and effort to help this girl! Should I not get something out of it?\" The answer to that riddle young grasshopper is an absolute and resounding \"no\". Helping people isn't about getting something in return. Rather, helping others is something that you do unconditionally because you're a good man and one upon whom others may depend on in their time of need. It very well might be the case that this ambitious girl played you like she probably has played others with her charm and good looks. But that doesn't matter. You didn't lose anything except a bit of time (which is debatable in itself since it sounded like you got to have a fun time hanging out with a pretty girl), and whatever mental energy you're currently exerting because you're mulling over what happened is not necessary. That's your choice and you can choose not to do it. \n\nBut this girl spent hours with you - of which only a few were dedicated to studying, while the rest were spent having a chill time. Why is that? Because this girl simply realized that you're a cool lad who is worth spending time with. You might not have realized this because you were too busy figuring out how you could bone her, but along the way you two probably became friends - at least that's likely how she interpreted your relationship. Nobody who only wants to use you because they need help with their homework would willingly spend hours upon hours hanging out with you pretending to have a good time. That's not how using people works (I should know I use people all the time). If you want to use someone you do the absolute bare minimum to keep that person on the hook. Doing any more than that is a waste of time that could instead be spent doing what you're getting others to do for you. In any case, I think you misinterpreted her friendliness and general interest in you for attraction. I think you were in her \"friend zone\" and by asking her out on a date you made things weird for her. She liked you as a friend and needed your help with school, so she gave you the most pass\u00e9 and noncommittal response a girl could ever give a guy who just asked her on a date \"sure, that sounds like it will be fun.\" Nobody who wants to fuck you will ever respond in that way, because their heart and brain will be racing from the fact that a person they like just asked them to go on a friggin date!!! Woop woop!!\n\nSo, let summarize where we are: a girl who is out of your league and one that's probably used to getting her way asks you for help, as a result you spend time together and end up - unbeknownst to you - becoming friends, at which point you proceed to put her in awkward situation by asking her on a date, she doesn't want to hurt your feelings or risk loosing your help (something that she by now has grown reliant on) so she pretends to accept while postponing actually going on a date because \"she's busy\". Now she no longer needs your help and you wonder why she hasn't responded to you about the date. That's because she never wanted to go on a date with you and you're making things weird by not reading her signs that she is just not that into you.\n\nLook, you shouldn't feel bad or confused by what happened. Communication between people is tricky, we are rarely able to truly express ourselves or understand what others mean (this isn't my opinion, this is science). Not to mention communication between young people of the opposite sex who are inexperienced and constrained by raging hormones is a complete clusterfuck (I don't think I made a real human connection until the age of 26 - but even that is debatable). What you need to realize is that you have a gift not many people have - you're smart enough in your subject area that good looking girls come talk to you and ask for your help. Now all you gotta do is learn how to make use of that gift. \n\nSo to ultimately answer your question - it's both: yes it is you and yes girls are sometimes just bat shit crazy. But that's women for you.  Can't live with them and can't fuck without them.

Also a difference between someone who does an awful thing once.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One big part of examining behavior (that took me forever to realize b/c I grew up in a very dysfunctional family where children were not allowed to criticize or even think about it) is looking at patterns of behavior and the thoughts behind them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does this person have ADHD? Is s/he trying their very best, but still not able to &amp;#39;get it&amp;#39;? Do they admit there is a problem, seek help, and earnestly put effort into making it better?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or do they make excuses, deflect the topic, refuse to discuss it, blame you for taking it too seriously, compare you unfavorably to other people, blame it on other people/traffic/weather/racism/the shape of the clouds, etc? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes explanations aren&amp;#39;t needed at all, and are just an attempt for the other person to justify themselves in their own mind. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not ok that he &amp;#39;forget&amp;#39; to do things he promised because it was boring, annoying, un-fun, he had a headache/rough day, &amp;#39;didn&amp;#39;t know how to&amp;#39;, etc. &amp;#39;Feigned incompetence&amp;#39; and being passive aggressive are two of his favorite techniques. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When one half of a couple acts like a child, the other half is forced to become the grown-up all the time. Otherwise cats don&amp;#39;t get to the vet, bills don&amp;#39;t get paid, the HOA starts charging fines for an unkempt yard, meds don&amp;#39;t get refilled, and trash piles up. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d39mm64", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1463563075.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1463534275.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d39lrx3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ThrityThird", "parent_id": "t1_d39jevh", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Shouldn't they though?
