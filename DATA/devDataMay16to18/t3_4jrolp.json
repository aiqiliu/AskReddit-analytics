He should be personally ashamed of himself, and we as a state carry that shame with him. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d39lb3r", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1463561352.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1463532552.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 11}}, {"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 21, "parent_id": "t1_d38ym31", "id": "d395qw1", "name": "t1_d395qw1", "children": ["d395qw1", "d3902qr", "d38z393", "d394gpa", "d39jwkf"]}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d38ym31", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "mtrund", "parent_id": "t3_4jrolp", "score": 72, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Mormons.
