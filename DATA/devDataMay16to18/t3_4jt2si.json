Actually, I'm approaching 30, and thinking about whether this is something to try and leave behind, or keep holding on. Thought about using a throwaway, but I'll own this. \n\nAround the age of 11ish, I began having \"nightmares\" of abductions and aliens. I don't remember much of it anymore, and even when it was happening, the memories were scattered. The usual medical stuff, some interview like processes. I would often go to bed terrified at night that they would come for me. I often slept with my bible in my hands hoping G-d would protect me. After several months of this, I starting talking to people about it, which went really poorly (I changed schools partly because I got teased so much).\n\nHowever, in talking about it with family members and researching other abductee stories, old memories that I had forgotten about had come to light. \n\nWhen I was a small child living with my grandparents, I often refused to sleep in my room, demanding to sleep in the living room \"so I could go with the spacemen\" and in the mornings talk about what I saw. \n\nAt many points as a child, I would wake up with strange cuts on my arms and legs, very straight and thin, and odd memories of \"mummies\" watching me. There was a large empty lot beside my house, and I would often go out looking for space ship prints, thinking there had been one. \n\nWhen I told my dad about it, he brought up a time several years ago I had bought a shirt with aliens on it, and talked about them before, and he was sick and tired of \"hearing about that alien shit\". \n\nTalking about it and researching it, I remember many times as a kid talking to my mom about what I would do if I was abducted, and how I cool it would be. I think that they psychically \"pump up\" abductees to make them more cooperative.\n\nRecently a game came out that heavily featured aliens, and since my friends played, I played too, and had a lot of nightmares. I tend to have flashbacks every few months, my wifey was used to them, but I never told her the true nature of them. After a few weeks of constant nightmares though, I had to tell her what was causing them. \n\nI still have a fear of wide open spaces at night, like fields and such. I only feel comfortable in the city, or with people around me. \n\nFew of my friends know about this, I've learned to keep it in the past and not talk about it.

Actually, I&amp;#39;m approaching 30, and thinking about whether this is something to try and leave behind, or keep holding on. Thought about using a throwaway, but I&amp;#39;ll own this. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Around the age of 11ish, I began having &amp;quot;nightmares&amp;quot; of abductions and aliens. I don&amp;#39;t remember much of it anymore, and even when it was happening, the memories were scattered. The usual medical stuff, some interview like processes. I would often go to bed terrified at night that they would come for me. I often slept with my bible in my hands hoping G-d would protect me. After several months of this, I starting talking to people about it, which went really poorly (I changed schools partly because I got teased so much).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, in talking about it with family members and researching other abductee stories, old memories that I had forgotten about had come to light. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I was a small child living with my grandparents, I often refused to sleep in my room, demanding to sleep in the living room &amp;quot;so I could go with the spacemen&amp;quot; and in the mornings talk about what I saw. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At many points as a child, I would wake up with strange cuts on my arms and legs, very straight and thin, and odd memories of &amp;quot;mummies&amp;quot; watching me. There was a large empty lot beside my house, and I would often go out looking for space ship prints, thinking there had been one. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I told my dad about it, he brought up a time several years ago I had bought a shirt with aliens on it, and talked about them before, and he was sick and tired of &amp;quot;hearing about that alien shit&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Talking about it and researching it, I remember many times as a kid talking to my mom about what I would do if I was abducted, and how I cool it would be. I think that they psychically &amp;quot;pump up&amp;quot; abductees to make them more cooperative.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recently a game came out that heavily featured aliens, and since my friends played, I played too, and had a lot of nightmares. I tend to have flashbacks every few months, my wifey was used to them, but I never told her the true nature of them. After a few weeks of constant nightmares though, I had to tell her what was causing them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I still have a fear of wide open spaces at night, like fields and such.
