There was a slight thud, so I turned around and it was clear she couldn't comprehend that she wasn't moving yet she was going upwards and she stumbled back and kinda missed a step, no big deal.\n\nThen there was a collection of thuds and she had just succumbed to the motion of the escalator and she had fallen, she was down. She had with her a small bag of shopping which I will come back to.
