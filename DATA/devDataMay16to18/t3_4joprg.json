You're wearing your favorite pair of daisy dukes, it don't matter if you're a guy or a gal, 'cause regardless, them hams need some sunlight after winter hid them away. Beside you, you've got a case of good ol' Pabst Blue Ribbon (cause all champion American stock drink PBR, it's God's piss in a can) and you're chillin' out, relaxin' in a beach chair on your front lawn with a boombox next to you, blasting your favorite pro-american song (must be country, cause if it isn't, then you are not American. Boo pop, booooo). Coursing through your veins at exactly 69.69mph(because us Americans are literal sex gods) is Red White and Blue, cause if you don't bleed the colors of the flag, you might as well be a damn commie! Screw you damn commies! In that patch of dirt you call a driveway is a huge, lifted truck, where a mural of a bald eagle rocking out on a guitar with Jimi Hendrix, super-imposed over an Americanflag, decorates the entirety of your rear windshield. Your favorite dog (must be your local, state-approved breed, cause how much more patriotic can you be? ...Just wait), he's also rockin' some daisy dukes and drinking PBR out of his American flag dog bowl, and to you, he/she is the living embodiment of the movie 'All Dogs Go to Heaven'. Suddenly, you get a phonecall. It's your boss, and he's asking you come in to work on your rare, once in a lifetime, day-off. How dare he, right?!?! Well, good thing you've already got that PBR cracked open, cause one more sip and you're about as relaxed as can be, and TOTALLY ready to handle this situation. You reply, 'Screw you, Jim, this is why I didn't come to your barbecue last week', then promptly hang up without giving him time to reply.  You take one more sip of your PBR, reach into the Holy Grail that is the 12-pack box it came from, only to find out you've ran out! What's that? There's this new app called 'Uber' that lets you order someone to drive you 'cause you're obviously drunk on a Monday at 1 in the afternoon? Screw that! You're American, you do what you want! So you climb your self-righteous derriere into that big ol' truck of yours and let those horses roar as you literally own the road to your nearest gas station to stock up on some more PBR, and maybe a pack of gum, cause when Karen gets home, you don't want your breath smelling like booze. Good thing the gas station is also an avid Trump supporter, cause now you're obligated to buy a sticker and slap it onto the bumper of every vehicle you own. You buy two, one for your truck and one that you're going to force your wife to display, and proudly. Cause if you ain't a Trump supporter, then how can you even call yourself a true American? Answer: You can't.\n\nDisclaimer: Don't drink and drive, kids. You'll go to hell! \n\nTL;DR: America is one damn free nation, and screw you if you aren't a Trump supporter! ...You stupid commie!
