The best of the worse in my mind was a requirement that guns be kept \"... unloaded and disassembled ...\". This phrase is from the DC firearms control act of 1975. \n\nThis led to DC v. Heller, a true landmark Supreme Court decision that ruled, among other things, gun ownership was an individual right and handguns are 'arms'. The losing argument was that 'A well regulated Militia' and 'the people', implied ownership was only a 'collective right'.\n\nCurrent 'assault weapon' legislation is, in my view, deeply flawed. Like in the past, the goal seems to be complete removal of an entire segment of firearms. The response to challenges to such legislation has largely been to refine, and thereby reduce the number of guns included in the proposed laws. At the Federal level this resulted in the law having an expiration date. \n\nIn Maryland (very broad law, and local for me), the testimony of a female teenager was responsible for removing one of the proposed 'tests' to determine if a gun met the definition of assault weapon (the sliding stock).\nIn her testimony in front of the House of Delegates she referred to it as a 'Goldilocks stock', since it allowed the length of the gun to be adjusted for each member of her family - an amazing moment.\n\nOne component of the Maryland law, magazine capacity, has since been rejected by a panel from the US Circuit Court. Again, the law was an attempt at absolute removal of a narrowly defined firearm component, but the Court's came back with a decision that rejected the basis of the entire law.\n\n If gun control advocates continue to view such weak legal arguments as successful, then they are their own worst enemy.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do not treat legal gun owners as the source of the problem&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Accept that guns are not going away&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Enforce laws we currently have&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Realize that there are no easy answers. No useful solution can from fear, panic or ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some the &amp;#39;biggest wins&amp;#39; for gun advocates are the result poorly thought out gun control legislation. The best of the worse in my mind was a requirement that guns be kept &amp;quot;... unloaded and disassembled ...&amp;quot;. This phrase is from the DC firearms control act of 1975. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This led to DC v. Heller, a true landmark Supreme Court decision that ruled, among other things, gun ownership was an individual right and handguns are &amp;#39;arms&amp;#39;. The losing argument was that &amp;#39;A well regulated Militia&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;the people&amp;#39;, implied ownership was only a &amp;#39;collective right&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Current &amp;#39;assault weapon&amp;#39; legislation is, in my view, deeply flawed. Like in the past, the goal seems to be complete removal of an entire segment of firearms. The response to challenges to such legislation has largely been to refine, and thereby reduce the number of guns included in the proposed laws. At the Federal level this resulted in the law having an expiration date. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Maryland (very broad law, and local for me), the testimony of a female teenager was responsible for removing one of the proposed &amp;#39;tests&amp;#39; to determine if a gun met the definition of assault weapon (the sliding stock).\nIn her testimony in front of the House of Delegates she referred to it as a &amp;#39;Goldilocks stock&amp;#39;, since it allowed the length of the gun to be adjusted for each member of her family - an amazing moment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One component of the Maryland law, magazine capacity, has since been rejected by a panel from the US Circuit Court. Again, the law was an attempt at absolute removal of a narrowly defined firearm component, but the Court&amp;#39;s came back with a decision that rejected the basis of the entire law.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If gun control advocates continue to view such weak legal arguments as successful, then they are their own worst enemy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d39tvhh", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1463573852.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1463545052.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4jta2u", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4jta2u", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d39dc98", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Kiss_Me_Im_Shitfaced", "parent_id": "t1_d39d86e", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Welfare programs should be scrutinized because they are grossly misused :)", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welfare programs should be scrutinized because they are grossly misused :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d39dc98", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1463550113.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1463521313.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d39d86e", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "HaikuHaiku", "parent_id": "t3_4jta2u", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 1, "body": "scrutinize black culture and welfare programs ", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;scrutinize black culture and welfare programs &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d39d86e", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1463549956.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1463521156.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 0}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4jta2u", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4jta2u", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4jta2u", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4jta2u", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4jta2u", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d39debh", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "parent_id": "t1_d39ddjl", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "No that's okay really", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;No that&amp;#39;s okay really&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d39debh", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1463550188.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1463521388.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d39ddjl", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Kiss_Me_Im_Shitfaced", "parent_id": "t1_d39dcc0", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Nope, I have a fully functioning brain and all my mental facilities.
