I was scared, I was confused, and I felt violated by this unwilling sexual act with someone who I no longer wanted to be with. I felt gross about it for WEEKS and of my friends/family who knew, some took it seriously but a lot didn&amp;#39;t. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She felt bad but - like many men in similar situations - disagreed that she had really &amp;quot;violated&amp;quot; me in a way that justified the word &amp;quot;rape&amp;quot; - even though she&amp;#39;d initiated sex with a sleeping person who she knew didn&amp;#39;t want to be with her. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want to stress here that while at first glance it&amp;#39;s easy to conclude that &amp;quot;male rape isn&amp;#39;t taken as seriously!&amp;quot;, my story is no different from that of countless women. You only need to spend a few minutes in any comments section to find a bunch of people trying to say that one scenario or another &lt;em&gt;isn&amp;#39;t actually rape&lt;/em&gt;. If I were a straight woman, I&amp;#39;d still have some friends thinking I was overreacting to some NBD misguided initiation, and I&amp;#39;d still have an ex-partner who refused to call it rape. But I&amp;#39;d also have several comments below this angrily explaining to me why I&amp;#39;m wrong about it being &amp;quot;rape&amp;quot;, connecting it to some bogeyman of feminism, trying to connect it to some rant about PC culture run amok, and all that crap. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So this is just your friendly reminder that most female victims of acquaintance rape aren&amp;#39;t fully taken seriously either. And a friendly reminder that much of the movement to legitimize the idea that &lt;em&gt;men can be raped too&lt;/em&gt; is coming from intersectional feminism, the bogeyman of reddit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(And before you ask, I&amp;#39;ve also been falsely accused of rape and I know what that&amp;#39;s like, so I&amp;#39;m sort of like the MRA-issues unicorn. And it has not changed my mind, rape rarely looks like what people think it looks like and alleged victims ought to be given the benefit of the doubt.) &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d37d1as", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1463427299.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1463398499.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4jiv7x", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d373zzw", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ijoju", "parent_id": "t3_4jiv7x", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I was at a party hosted by a friend of a friend.
