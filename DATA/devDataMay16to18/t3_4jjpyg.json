I don&amp;#39;t know anything about guns, I&amp;#39;m not comfortable around them, and this lady just told me she refuses to take her anti-psychotics and also that the cops don&amp;#39;t want her to have a gun but she has one anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She tries making conversation with me in particular and I didn&amp;#39;t realize she was talking to ME, so I wasn&amp;#39;t looking at her, and she starts getting mad that I&amp;#39;m ignoring her. My heart is pounding and I&amp;#39;m like so sure I&amp;#39;m going to die in a shitty mall getting my hair cut so I&amp;#39;m pretty terrified and not firing on all cylinders. When the crazy lady says &amp;quot;why is she ignoring me?&amp;quot; My stylist, also freaked out, literally turns my head toward the crazy lady and is like, &amp;quot;TALK to the woman!&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I talk to her and try to play it cool and listen to her. And she&amp;#39;s just going on about how I should stay in school and finish school and not leave school. (I&amp;#39;m 32. I look pretty young for my age and I wasn&amp;#39;t gonna argue with her but I seriously have never wanted so badly to look my age as I did that day, because I think she would have left me alone if I looked older.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thankfully the crazy lady didn&amp;#39;t shoot me in the fucking head like I expected her to, but I seriously was so scared I can&amp;#39;t even remember the rest of the day clearly after I saw her gun. I&amp;#39;ve been through other scary things but that was seriously the most terrified I&amp;#39;ve ever been. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Never going back there to get a haircut. In fact, haven&amp;#39;t gotten my hair cut since then.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr - Scary lady at hair salon who bragged about being off her meds showed me her gun, mistook me for a teen, manically told me to stay in school, made me almost shit my pants.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d37867x", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1463409740.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1463380940.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4jjpyg", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d378kw3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ImmortanJoe", "parent_id": "t3_4jjpyg", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Went to study in Australia, and ended up being a little punk, constantly cutting class and getting wasted.
