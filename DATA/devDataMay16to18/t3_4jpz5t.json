We got kind of trashed and someone screamed &amp;quot;LETS GO PLAY MAN HUNT IN THE CEMETERY!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My friend lives 2 blocks away from a really big Cemetery so we all decided to go play man hunt (there were about 15 of us that night). We got there and jumped the fence (which was really really hard to do without dieing because of the spiked top) but once we got 2 people in they opened the smaller side gate. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we started playing and began running around screaming and playing manhunt in the dark like a bunch of 13 years olds but after about an hour we see 3 cop cars pull up to the main gate. They have a truck with them (later we found out was the city care taker) who opened the main larger gate and let the cops in. The cops then begin to slowly drive along the paths with their spot lights all over the place. We all went into silent fear mode and began crawling behind grave stones and crypts avoiding the spot lights like some sort of video game. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4 of us get caught while the rest scatter for the side gate.
