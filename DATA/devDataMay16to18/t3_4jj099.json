The head matriarch of the party, whom we'll refer to as \"Granny\", wants to order child size dishes for her grandkids. The server kindly informs her that we don't offer child size, but says that a small size is usually enough to satisfy two children. Granny says, \"oh no no no no, nobody at my table will eat from the same plate as someone else! That is just savage! My grandchildren will each have a small dish!\" The server suggests that she only order one small to start if her grandchildren really don't eat that much (the portions are pretty substantial), and even offers to split one small dish onto two plates. Granny insists, and puts in an order for two smalls. Meanwhile, the other members (at least one of which I had assumed to be the parent of at least one of the children) of the party aren't talking. Actually, the rest of the party never talked throughout the entire time there. They just listened to Granny ramble on. It was very silent and awkward.
