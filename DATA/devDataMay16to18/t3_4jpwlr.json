We got engaged 10 months ago now, when I was 19. We live together now (moved in after we got engaged) and we always say it&amp;#39;s like a permanent sleepover. Last night we talked for a solid 2 hours before actually going to sleep. We are both university students but we both work and aren&amp;#39;t supported by our parents. I&amp;#39;ve lived out of home since I was 17. We are paying for our wedding from our own savings. And having a 3 week honeymoon, also on our own savings. Neither of us has a credit card and we lend money to our parents more often than they lend money to us. Neither of us have ever worked full time and we both worked entry level jobs until this year (eg. retail/fast food for me; programming/tech support for my fiance).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, if you&amp;#39;re getting married, you need to be completely independent and shouldn&amp;#39;t rely on your parents for financial help. Financial problems bring down a lot of marriages so in my relationship, it was important for me to make sure that we are both good with money and can trust each other with money. You don&amp;#39;t have to be rich, just know how to live within your means. We also have a ton of fun together and can talk about anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d38ms07", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1463510631.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1463481831.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
