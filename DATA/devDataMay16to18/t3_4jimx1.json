I have an MTHFR mutation, which means I have near permanent depression and anxiety. they are lowered with medicine, but not completely gone. last summer I was invited by my boyfriend to go to Colorado and I immediately said yes because I yearn for adventure even though my anxiety and depression tugged at the back of my mind telling me not to do it. we went to his aunts house in the mountains in a tiny town. nothing was commercial and you could only get service in one corner of the house, but it was spectacular. I trekked a small ways up a mountain near their home, went to Denver and tried food outside of my small safety circle for the first time in years, got over my fear of heights by going to the royal gorge bridge (tallest suspension bridge in the US) and walking across it... it felt like everything happened at once and id found my heart. going home destroyed me but going to Colorado has been the highlight of my entire life. it made me forget everything except for adventure and happiness and the exploration of wilderness. I&amp;#39;ve learned to experience more and I have said yes to more adventure so much more than I used to&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d36wbp2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1463385742.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1463356942.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d36vyfk", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TheRealAlamo", "parent_id": "t1_d36vvj6", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "What changed specifically after going and doing that?", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What changed specifically after going and doing that?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d36vyfk", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1463385072.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1463356272.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d36vvj6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "dlolb", "parent_id": "t3_4jimx1", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "going out of state and really experiencing something helped a lot ", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;going out of state and really experiencing something helped a lot &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d36vvj6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1463384923.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1463356123.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4jimx1", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d36vwkc", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "KZD2016", "parent_id": "t3_4jimx1", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Medication.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medication.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d36vwkc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1463384976.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1463356176.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4jimx1", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4jimx1", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d36vzjy", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TheRealAlamo", "parent_id": "t1_d36vx2b", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm sorry to hear that, I hope things turn around for you soon.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sorry to hear that, I hope things turn around for you soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d36vzjy", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1463385129.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1463356329.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d36vx2b", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "parent_id": "t3_4jimx1", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "[deleted]", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[deleted]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d36vx2b", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1463385003.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1463356203.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4jimx1", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d36vz1s", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "jspangles313", "parent_id": "t3_4jimx1", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I've had pretty terrible experiences with talk therapy.
