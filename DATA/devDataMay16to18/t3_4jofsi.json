One I&amp;#39;ve hung out with for a very long time now, but we are becoming drastically different people. We no longer have anything in common or similar interests, we hold drastically different beliefs and our lifestyles are drastically different. Neither of us really make the attempt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel less bad about it because it doesn&amp;#39;t really feel malicious. We&amp;#39;re just becoming different people, and when you&amp;#39;ve been friends with the same people since high school, you tend to go separate ways.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But either way, I&amp;#39;ve been terrible at being a friend, I think. It&amp;#39;s tough.
