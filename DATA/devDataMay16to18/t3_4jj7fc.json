There was very little (if any) homework, everything was done on computers, and every piece of academic knowledge had an immediate and appreciable real-world application. It was a rigorous and in-depth experience, and far better - at least in my opinion - than a typical educational environment.\n\nIt wasn't without its pitfalls, though.\n\nSee, as a result of the computer-centric schooling model, every student had a personal account connected to Lotus Notes (which was essentially an email client with a few extra bells and whistles)... and one of its many peripherals gave users the ability to draft interactive messages, complete with functional buttons, active scripts, and customized text. That may not sound like an especially tempting tool, but from my point of view, it was something like a supervillain's dream. After a bit of experimentation, I managed to create a script that would - upon being activated by the opening of an email - send a message from the victim's account (with the subject \"FREE COOKIES!\") to everyone in the school.\n\nIt seemed harmless. It *should have been* harmless... except that something went wrong. Somehow, my benign little script took on a sinister aspect, so that when activated, it did more than send the \"FREE COOKIES!\" messages: It also attached itself to the emails and forwarded itself to each recipient. Unfortunately, I didn't realize this until after I had already sent the message to my intended victim. Shortly after he opened it, though, the demon I'd created reared its head.\n\nSuddenly, what was meant as a silly prank became a major issue. Each student who opened the \"FREE COOKIES!\" message sent out another massive broadcast of the same email. It turned into an enormous cascade of \"FREE COOKIES!\" subject lines showing up for everyone, and the network was put under considerable strain. Eventually - as was inevitable - the issue was traced back to me, and I had my email privileges revoked for a week. (It was rather like in-school suspension, except that I still had to attend class.) \n\nFortunately, I still had access to Photoshop, so I spent that week creating satirical advice brochures, which I left on the display near the front office.\n\nOf course, that's another story entirely.\n\n**TL;DR: I (accidentally) learned the basics of supervillainy, followed by graphic design.**", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I went to a high school that was centered around the concepts of project-based learning and technological expertise.

After a bit of experimentation, I managed to create a script that would - upon being activated by the opening of an email - send a message from the victim&amp;#39;s account (with the subject &amp;quot;FREE COOKIES!&amp;quot;) to everyone in the school.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It seemed harmless. It &lt;em&gt;should have been&lt;/em&gt; harmless... except that something went wrong. Somehow, my benign little script took on a sinister aspect, so that when activated, it did more than send the &amp;quot;FREE COOKIES!&amp;quot; messages: It also attached itself to the emails and forwarded itself to each recipient. Unfortunately, I didn&amp;#39;t realize this until after I had already sent the message to my intended victim. Shortly after he opened it, though, the demon I&amp;#39;d created reared its head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, what was meant as a silly prank became a major issue. Each student who opened the &amp;quot;FREE COOKIES!&amp;quot; message sent out another massive broadcast of the same email. It turned into an enormous cascade of &amp;quot;FREE COOKIES!&amp;quot; subject lines showing up for everyone, and the network was put under considerable strain. Eventually - as was inevitable - the issue was traced back to me, and I had my email privileges revoked for a week. (It was rather like in-school suspension, except that I still had to attend class.) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, I still had access to Photoshop, so I spent that week creating satirical advice brochures, which I left on the display near the front office.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, that&amp;#39;s another story entirely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR: I (accidentally) learned the basics of supervillainy, followed by graphic design.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d372csj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1463396271.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1463367471.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 32}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4jj7fc", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4jj7fc", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4jj7fc", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d373wab", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Master_apprentice", "parent_id": "t1_d372zx9", "score": 6, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Being told the local admin password isn't hacking", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being told the local admin password isn&amp;#39;t hacking&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d373wab", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1463399179.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1463370379.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4jj7fc", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d373z8z", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "FuzzyWu", "parent_id": "t1_d372zx9", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Do you think he hacked into the senior?

The former script is responsible for determining if your username and password match. The latter applies permissions and restrictions to your account based on your role. \n\nI found that if you yanked the ethernet cord out of the pc about 1sec after entering your credentials you could interrupt this process by eliminating network connectivity after that Auth script had run but before the bash script had started. \n\nThe result: the Novell client would spin for a couple minutes then it would crash and the OS would finish loading windows as through there were no network software at all. This meant no blocks, no monitoring, etc. \n\nAs an added bonus, each student who had used the machine in the recent past would still have a bunch of files saved locally in the cache.

The user control was secure enough that you couldn't delete any files, but you could read them and add your own.\n\nThe second security flaw was that people's passwords weren't randomly generated, but there was a system, and you couldn't change your password. \n\n(Interjection to say that I went to a bog-standard UK state school, but it sometimes had grandeur of being a private school. So some of the terms I realise might not be familiar to some users here!)\n\nThe first two digits depended on your Year group. Mostly, it was the year (grade) they were in when their accounts were allocated - so if they were in Year 9, their password would start with 09 - but there were other variants as well that I can't recall.\n\nThe second two digits depended on what house (divisions of the Year group) you were in. My school only had four houses, and they were always listed off in the same order, so it would either be 01, 02, 03, or 04. \n\nThe final three digits were where you were on a list of everybody in the year listed alphabetically. So, if your name was Aaron A Aarronson, you would likely be 001. There were a few oddities where if somebody came into the school during a year they might be just at the end, but by and large this was the case.\n\nSo, it was quite easy to find people's logins as you could often just see what people were typing in, and as long as you saw at least the final two digits, you could know what their password was and log in. For other people, you could just ask them what the last two digits were and, not knowing the system, they'd usually just tell you.
