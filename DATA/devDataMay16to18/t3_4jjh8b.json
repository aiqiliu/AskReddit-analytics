It was a minimum wage job and after about a week, I quit. \nAt first the job started out OK. Customers made orders for ice cream, and ice cream had to be shipped. My job was to go into the freezer with a cart and a list of what a customer wanted, pack the cart/\"u-boat\", and bring it out for the trucks. Despite the freezing cold, minimum lunch break, lifting things up and putting them down, it was ok. \nThen I had to do things like chip ice off of the sides of the freezer. Since my coworkers were hiding from the bosses a lot (and they were also morons in general; I felt like I was getting dumb just working with them), I got stuck with more work. It eventually became very exhausting. \nWhat did it for me though, was that one day, the bosses rolled out a pallet full of boxes of popsicles. He then told us that our job now was to unpack each box, take out the popsicles, get some nail polish remover, and wipe the expiration dates off of the labels. Some of these ice creams were expired for well over a year.\nThey also said they had enough pallets to keep us occupied for a long while. Kids eat ice cream.

My job was to go into the freezer with a cart and a list of what a customer wanted, pack the cart/&amp;quot;u-boat&amp;quot;, and bring it out for the trucks. Despite the freezing cold, minimum lunch break, lifting things up and putting them down, it was ok. \nThen I had to do things like chip ice off of the sides of the freezer.
