Everyone was downloading the same crap, media/entertainment industries shat themselves and everything felt cheap, the few good things that came out of those years you **had** to know them, everyone watched the same crap just to fit in and have something to talk about.  \nBut now, now is perfect. We have so many good shows you can't watch them all, so when I meet *that* friend who's the only person I know IRL who watches *that* show, I feel that intimacy, that complicity again.   \nThe rise of indie games brought some masterpieces built on decisions only a small team can make, those games aren't made for the 'every male and female from age 7 to 99' demographic. Of course there are now millions of crappy games, especially on smartphones, but the 0.00001% is just wonderful and that's actually a lot.   \nSame goes for music, I'm not forced to follow the flavor of the month/year anymore, so many good things in every genre, available by a simple clic, I used to have to drive for two hours to find decent music/music that wasn't on every radio in the 90's.   \nFood is definitely better than ever, it's overall more healthy and I can eat anything from any continent, again, I had to drive 2 hours to eat some cheap Japanese in the 90's. In my small town 'exotic' food was either Chinese or Italian. Now I can eat dishes from everywhere either delivered or I can cook it as the ingredients are available either online or at my supermarket.   \nMovies... movies are getting good again, God I missed getting suprised by a Reservoir Dogs or a Lost Highway in the 2000's. Of course there is still a lot of crap but when you find an Enemy or a Primer you forget about the rehashed superhero movies or the crappy remakes. Hell, we even had the best Star Wars movie in years (I agree it's not perfect but still better than the last trilogy IMHO)  \nAnd the Internet, OMG, the Internet during the 2000's was crap, I felt dirty every time I used it. It reflected the worst of most people, they used to hide behind their nickname and be the worst douchebags ever. Now more and more people are comfortable with using their real identity and don't try to outsmart the next guy. People share personal experiences, help each other, and create awesome content. Of course there are still complete assholes, like, a lot of them, but the few who are true and positive are actually worth it.   \nAnd everything changes so fast, we used to wait for months or even years for a simple evolution of our lifestyle. We used to talk about how it would be nice to be able to place calls from our wrist in... 20 years...

", "edited": 1463394367.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;TBH I used to regret the 1990&amp;#39;s during the 2000&amp;#39;s, better music, better shows, better movies, better video games, the pop culture was like a little secret everyone was aware of but only talked about with close friends... all of this was somehow ruined by 2000&amp;#39;s Internet. Everyone was downloading the same crap, media/entertainment industries shat themselves and everything felt cheap, the few good things that came out of those years you &lt;strong&gt;had&lt;/strong&gt; to know them, everyone watched the same crap just to fit in and have something to talk about.&lt;br/&gt;\nBut now, now is perfect. We have so many good shows you can&amp;#39;t watch them all, so when I meet &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; friend who&amp;#39;s the only person I know IRL who watches &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; show, I feel that intimacy, that complicity again.&lt;br/&gt;\nThe rise of indie games brought some masterpieces built on decisions only a small team can make, those games aren&amp;#39;t made for the &amp;#39;every male and female from age 7 to 99&amp;#39; demographic. Of course there are now millions of crappy games, especially on smartphones, but the 0.00001% is just wonderful and that&amp;#39;s actually a lot.&lt;br/&gt;\nSame goes for music, I&amp;#39;m not forced to follow the flavor of the month/year anymore, so many good things in every genre, available by a simple clic, I used to have to drive for two hours to find decent music/music that wasn&amp;#39;t on every radio in the 90&amp;#39;s.&lt;br/&gt;\nFood is definitely better than ever, it&amp;#39;s overall more healthy and I can eat anything from any continent, again, I had to drive 2 hours to eat some cheap Japanese in the 90&amp;#39;s. In my small town &amp;#39;exotic&amp;#39; food was either Chinese or Italian. Now I can eat dishes from everywhere either delivered or I can cook it as the ingredients are available either online or at my supermarket.&lt;br/&gt;\nMovies... movies are getting good again, God I missed getting suprised by a Reservoir Dogs or a Lost Highway in the 2000&amp;#39;s. Of course there is still a lot of crap but when you find an Enemy or a Primer you forget about the rehashed superhero movies or the crappy remakes. Hell, we even had the best Star Wars movie in years (I agree it&amp;#39;s not perfect but still better than the last trilogy IMHO)&lt;br/&gt;\nAnd the Internet, OMG, the Internet during the 2000&amp;#39;s was crap, I felt dirty every time I used it. It reflected the worst of most people, they used to hide behind their nickname and be the worst douchebags ever. Now more and more people are comfortable with using their real identity and don&amp;#39;t try to outsmart the next guy. People share personal experiences, help each other, and create awesome content. Of course there are still complete assholes, like, a lot of them, but the few who are true and positive are actually worth it.&lt;br/&gt;\nAnd everything changes so fast, we used to wait for months or even years for a simple evolution of our lifestyle.
