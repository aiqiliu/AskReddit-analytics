Any time somebody tries to dispute that suggestion, you insult their intelligence and dodge the question by saying they're changing the subject.\n\nLet me tell you a thing or two about transgenderism: *it is not an easy process.* I know this because I have several transgender friends and I've watched them both before, during and, in some cases, after the process. It's one of the most daunting commitments a person can make - psychologically, physically and financially.\n\nFirst off, you have to be psychologically evaluated to ensure you're a suitable candidate for gender reassignment. This means you have to be gender dysphoric and this has to be medically certified and documented by a qualified medical professional, and this may involve psychotherapeutic sessions to determine eligibility; you have to be able to demonstrate that you're of sound mind and can make rational, consenting decisions; and you have to ensure that any medical conditions (psychological or physical) that you have are not so severe that they will affect the process. Certain surgeons will also require notes of confirmation of your gender dysphoria from the psychotherapist or psychologist that has overseen the psych evaluation. Beyond that, it's often suggested, or even mandatory depending on the region, that you live for a full year as the sex you wish to be reassigned to in order to adjust and determine if reassignment is suitable for you, called \"RTE\"  (\"Real-Time Experience\") - a sort of \"trial run\", if you will. RTE itself often involves hormone replacement therapy, hair removal and / or facial restructuring surgery in order for you to fit the sex you wish to be reassigned to before you can even begin the process of full reassignment surgery.\n\nIf you get through all of that and it's been determined that you're psychologically good to go *and* you still want to do it, *then* you can begin the process of gender reassignment surgery.\n\nIt's an expensive surgery, and most surgeons will expect upwards of $7,000 or $8,000 dollars, but it can go as high $24,000 for men-to-women and even higher than $50,000 for women-to-men. It varies depending on the region you're in, but that's a professional estimate: even if you do it on the cheap (and have fun finding a qualified surgeon to do that for ya), it's a massive financial demanding that's just one more step in a detailed, irrevocably life-changing decision.\n\nThat's the other thing to point out: gender reassignment is *irreversible*. You can't just go into a pharmacist's shop, order a vagina over-the-counter, toss it on and then take it off when you're done with it. That's not how it works, and to suggest otherwise is both fundamentally ignorant of the process and extremely insulting to transgender people that have gone through this process and just want to be respected for who they are.\n\nIs it possible that transgender people will abuse others if they get to use the bathroom of the sex they identify with? Sure. But if that happens, the overwhelmingly likely reason for it is that they're recognised as gender dysphoric, underwent the process and had their sex surgically and biologically reassigned and *happened* to be paedophiles as well. I don't know much about the psychological side of things, since I haven't been there myself, but I'm pretty sure there exist checks and balances to ensure they'd figure out pretty quickly if a person is a paedophile and *especially* if they want to undergo reassignment because their end goal is to fiddle kids. They'd be turfed out of that clinic so fast, their head would spin.\n\nSo if you've read all of that and *still* think your point is valid...\n\nAnd I've been trying very hard to determine what your point is to begin with, but you've been so difficult to debate with that I don't entirely know what it is, but here's my best estimate as to what you've been trying to say:\n\n&gt;I'm saying that people who look like men but have a vagina are allowed in female bathrooms he could be a pervert and sexually assault and molest, both ways. And you could have male child molesters get a vagina just to be able to get into the girls public bathroom and molest and sexually assault.\n\n&gt;WOW YOUR STUPID. A man with a dick, could go get a pussy, that doesn't make him a women. You obviously don't get it, and if you do your ignorance is mind numbing. Just know if transgender people do get to go in their 'right' public bathroom, their will be rape, sexual assault and perverted shit happening because of it, which will imply other laws. A guy child molester with a penis atm, could get a vagina just to molest and sexually assault women in public bathrooms.\n\nThen I don't think the problem here is pretend predators. I think the problem is something much, much closer to home.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, your &amp;quot;point&amp;quot; is not proven, because you haven&amp;#39;t made a point beyond &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m scared of transgenders because they could be paedophiles trying to hurt kids with their new over-the-counter pussy&amp;quot;. Any time somebody tries to dispute that suggestion, you insult their intelligence and dodge the question by saying they&amp;#39;re changing the subject.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you a thing or two about transgenderism: &lt;em&gt;it is not an easy process.&lt;/em&gt; I know this because I have several transgender friends and I&amp;#39;ve watched them both before, during and, in some cases, after the process. It&amp;#39;s one of the most daunting commitments a person can make - psychologically, physically and financially.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First off, you have to be psychologically evaluated to ensure you&amp;#39;re a suitable candidate for gender reassignment. This means you have to be gender dysphoric and this has to be medically certified and documented by a qualified medical professional, and this may involve psychotherapeutic sessions to determine eligibility; you have to be able to demonstrate that you&amp;#39;re of sound mind and can make rational, consenting decisions; and you have to ensure that any medical conditions (psychological or physical) that you have are not so severe that they will affect the process. Certain surgeons will also require notes of confirmation of your gender dysphoria from the psychotherapist or psychologist that has overseen the psych evaluation. Beyond that, it&amp;#39;s often suggested, or even mandatory depending on the region, that you live for a full year as the sex you wish to be reassigned to in order to adjust and determine if reassignment is suitable for you, called &amp;quot;RTE&amp;quot;  (&amp;quot;Real-Time Experience&amp;quot;) - a sort of &amp;quot;trial run&amp;quot;, if you will. RTE itself often involves hormone replacement therapy, hair removal and / or facial restructuring surgery in order for you to fit the sex you wish to be reassigned to before you can even begin the process of full reassignment surgery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you get through all of that and it&amp;#39;s been determined that you&amp;#39;re psychologically good to go &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; you still want to do it, &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; you can begin the process of gender reassignment surgery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s an expensive surgery, and most surgeons will expect upwards of $7,000 or $8,000 dollars, but it can go as high $24,000 for men-to-women and even higher than $50,000 for women-to-men. It varies depending on the region you&amp;#39;re in, but that&amp;#39;s a professional estimate: even if you do it on the cheap (and have fun finding a qualified surgeon to do that for ya), it&amp;#39;s a massive financial demanding that&amp;#39;s just one more step in a detailed, irrevocably life-changing decision.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the other thing to point out: gender reassignment is &lt;em&gt;irreversible&lt;/em&gt;. You can&amp;#39;t just go into a pharmacist&amp;#39;s shop, order a vagina over-the-counter, toss it on and then take it off when you&amp;#39;re done with it. That&amp;#39;s not how it works, and to suggest otherwise is both fundamentally ignorant of the process and extremely insulting to transgender people that have gone through this process and just want to be respected for who they are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is it possible that transgender people will abuse others if they get to use the bathroom of the sex they identify with? Sure. But if that happens, the overwhelmingly likely reason for it is that they&amp;#39;re recognised as gender dysphoric, underwent the process and had their sex surgically and biologically reassigned and &lt;em&gt;happened&lt;/em&gt; to be paedophiles as well. I don&amp;#39;t know much about the psychological side of things, since I haven&amp;#39;t been there myself, but I&amp;#39;m pretty sure there exist checks and balances to ensure they&amp;#39;d figure out pretty quickly if a person is a paedophile and &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; if they want to undergo reassignment because their end goal is to fiddle kids. They&amp;#39;d be turfed out of that clinic so fast, their head would spin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if you&amp;#39;ve read all of that and &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; think your point is valid...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#39;ve been trying very hard to determine what your point is to begin with, but you&amp;#39;ve been so difficult to debate with that I don&amp;#39;t entirely know what it is, but here&amp;#39;s my best estimate as to what you&amp;#39;ve been trying to say:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m saying that people who look like men but have a vagina are allowed in female bathrooms he could be a pervert and sexually assault and molest, both ways.
