Ugh, probably the deepest rabbit hole I've gone chasing on the internet.  And I still don't understand all of it. \n\nSo in the Czech Republic, 2007, a father sets up a baby monitor to check on his newborn.  But when he turns it on, instead of seeing his own baby asleep in his crib, he instead sees an image of a 8 year old boy, naked, tied-up, in a corner of a dirty cellar.   He calls the cops.  The cops realize the guy has accidentally gotten a signal from the same baby monitor in a nearby house, so they go door-to-door to figure out where it is.  They find the Mauerova sisters. \n\nThe Mauerova's are two adult sisters who live together.  The older sister is a single mom of two young boys.  She has also recently adopted a 13-year-old girl named Anna.  It's her boys that are tied up in a cellar being tortured.  It's her boys that have had skin peeled off their body, fried in a pan, and served to their mother and aunt.\n\nTurns out they are part of a cult and that is why they are abusing the boys.  Initially, the cops think the girl Anna is being abused too, but she doesn't have any of the same burns, bruises, or scars, and the boys (who heart-breakingly keep insisting that they *deserve* the \"punishment\" the adults gave them because they were \"bad\") confirm that the girl isn't ever touched.  And that, in fact, the abuse didn't start until after she came to live with them, and that she typically is included in dishing out the punishments to the boys.  \n\nAnd then you find out that 13-year-old Anna, is actually 33-year-old Barbora Skrlova.  We find that out when she runs away to another country and shaves her head to pose as a 14-year-old boy.  Fortunately she is caught and dragged back to face prosecution.\n\nAnd she is the daughter of the cult leader, who is apparently trying to set her up to be worshiped as a saint? a Savior?  I don't actually know.  They claim they're part of the Grail Movement, but the rest of the Grail Movement insists they are outsiders who aren't part of that religion. \n\nIt's all so very, very crazy.  The rabbit hole runs deep on this one.

Ugh, probably the deepest rabbit hole I&amp;#39;ve gone chasing on the internet.  And I still don&amp;#39;t understand all of it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So in the Czech Republic, 2007, a father sets up a baby monitor to check on his newborn.  But when he turns it on, instead of seeing his own baby asleep in his crib, he instead sees an image of a 8 year old boy, naked, tied-up, in a corner of a dirty cellar.   He calls the cops.  The cops realize the guy has accidentally gotten a signal from the same baby monitor in a nearby house, so they go door-to-door to figure out where it is.  They find the Mauerova sisters. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Mauerova&amp;#39;s are two adult sisters who live together.  The older sister is a single mom of two young boys.  She has also recently adopted a 13-year-old girl named Anna.  It&amp;#39;s her boys that are tied up in a cellar being tortured.  It&amp;#39;s her boys that have had skin peeled off their body, fried in a pan, and served to their mother and aunt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Turns out they are part of a cult and that is why they are abusing the boys.  Initially, the cops think the girl Anna is being abused too, but she doesn&amp;#39;t have any of the same burns, bruises, or scars, and the boys (who heart-breakingly keep insisting that they &lt;em&gt;deserve&lt;/em&gt; the &amp;quot;punishment&amp;quot; the adults gave them because they were &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot;) confirm that the girl isn&amp;#39;t ever touched.  And that, in fact, the abuse didn&amp;#39;t start until after she came to live with them, and that she typically is included in dishing out the punishments to the boys.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then you find out that 13-year-old Anna, is actually 33-year-old Barbora Skrlova.  We find that out when she runs away to another country and shaves her head to pose as a 14-year-old boy.  Fortunately she is caught and dragged back to face prosecution.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And she is the daughter of the cult leader, who is apparently trying to set her up to be worshiped as a saint? a Savior?  I don&amp;#39;t actually know.  They claim they&amp;#39;re part of the Grail Movement, but the rest of the Grail Movement insists they are outsiders who aren&amp;#39;t part of that religion. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s all so very, very crazy.
