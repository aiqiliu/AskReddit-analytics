Anyways, one time in middle school the mean teacher came over and for once started to talk to the group of friends i was in. Something funny happened and everyone laughed, after everyone settled down I was still laughing and my voice croaked. I made this really weird high pitched laugh that echoed through the room. The teacher just looked at me with a disgusted face and went back to work, I skipped school the next day because of it. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d383zmr", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1463469298.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1463440498.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 45}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4jnkea", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4jnkea", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4jnkea", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d38b4os", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "mahiruhanayo", "parent_id": "t1_d386w1n", "score": 47, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "The world may never know.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world may never know.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d38b4os", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1463480259.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1463451459.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 47}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4jnkea", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d38kdk6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ForgettableUsername", "parent_id": "t1_d386w1n", "score": 12, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Having a map gives one perspective.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having a map gives one perspective.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d38kdk6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1463501560.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1463472760.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 12}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4jnkea", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d38eapp", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "iAmWerfs", "parent_id": "t1_d386w1n", "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "it's a small world after all", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;it&amp;#39;s a small world after all&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d38eapp", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1463485371.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1463456571.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d386w1n", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Kip_karo", "parent_id": "t1_d3857u8", "score": 23, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Haha why?", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haha why?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d386w1n", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1463473797.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1463444997.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 23}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4jnkea", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4jnkea", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4jnkea", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d38lmr4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "itmustbethursday42", "parent_id": "t1_d38kt0w", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I laughed way too hard at your misery, friend.
