Soon, the doctor had to call the police to get involved.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Apparently, this rash is something you catch from contact with dead bodies, and the fact that it was transmitted via mouth-to-mouth contact meant this guy had probably been either kissing or &lt;em&gt;eating&lt;/em&gt; dead people, and it wasn&amp;#39;t much of a stretch to consider that he&amp;#39;d killed whoever he was doing that too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;IIRC, the report was passed on to the police in whatever city the bloke lived in, who launched an investigation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d37dk09", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1463428780.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1463399980.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4jjh7m", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d378vu1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "chicke1129", "parent_id": "t3_4jjh7m", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "So I'm a fashion model.

All of these people at the party are wondering WTF I'm doing but I don't care. I see with the flashlight that there is a good amount of space between the floorboards and the actual ground (which was covered in dirt and leaves and twigs), so the chances of me finding this teeny tiny tooth of mine are pretty slim. reality sets in and I think about my upcoming meeting in three days which just so happens to be the biggest meeting of my life and I pull my boyfriend aside and relay my anxiety/panic attack onto him, explain to him that I'm a toothless swimsuit model and how am I supposed to be sexy if I look like a crazy person etc etc, basically start losing it and throw a huge tantrum, run to his car and start bawling my eyes out.\n\nSo while I'm in the car I'm having a full blown panic attack being really dramatic and not able to contain myself, my boyfriend comes back and tries to console me, but there's literally nothing that will bring me back to reality at this point other than the discovery of my missing tooth..\n\nsoooo....\n\nI continue to freak out for about 5 more minutes and then I hear my boyfriends name being screamed from back at the party. his friend comes over to the car with his hands clasped together.... low and behold my missing tooth was in the palm of this friends hand. this friend who I had literally just met this night. he spent a good twenty minutes looking for my tooth through the floorboards while I was being a prissy bitch having a freak out and actually FOUND it. and not only FOUND it, but was able to retrieve it through the floorboards. he told me that he was able to extract the tooth from beneath the floorboards by getting a stick that would fit through the cracks, and he put a piece of tape on the end of the stick, and was then able to stick the tape end of the stick to the tooth in the dirt, and successfully rise it back up through the floorboards without the tooth unsticking from the tape.\n\nI'm not sure if I've ever experienced more shock and disbelief ever...... I hug and kiss and thank my boyfriends friend and we go back to the party and everything is great, I get back to NYC and find a dentist who is able to cement the tooth back in for me temporarily for my meeting. \n\nThe meeting went well, I ended up not booking the job but I got a hell of a good story out of the whole deal.\n\n", "edited": 1463383641.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m a fashion model.
