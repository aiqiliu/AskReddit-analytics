Never got fingered for that one, though they \"knew.\" \n\n* Used the plastic mold-maker in shop class to make a penis. \n\n* Spray-painted a penis on the dent door of another kid in shop class because \"you have to give it a fresh paint job as part of the assignment anyway.\"\n\n* In geography, one cute thing they teach you is that if you look at a [US map](http://www.yourchildlearns.com/online-atlas/images/map-of-united-states-2.gif) Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Arkansas and Louisiana all kind of look like a little man, and it's an easy way to remember the states along the Mississippi river. Someone helpfully pointed out that Kentucky made it look like he was holding a chicken leg. The teacher liked that. I pointed out that Tennessee looked like his boner. The teacher did not like that as much. \n\n* Kicked out of gym class for exploring the cold-war tunnels under the school that connected to a maintenance door by the boy's locker room. \n\n* Told the home Ec teacher I didn't need her course because I planned \"to do more with my life than be a housewife.\" \n\n* Went to my teacher's computer, created a folder labeled \"horse porn\" took a screenshot, made that the desktop background and deleted the folder. Teacher spent a good 5 minutes freaking out and trying to get rid of it. Didn't get kicked out on condition of fixing it. \n\n* Dressed as the Goblin King from Labyrinth one Halloween. Apparently codpieces are discouraged in high school. \n\n* Was told to stop running DDoS attacks against teachers I didn't like in my Java programming class. Think the teacher may have been secretly proud about that one.\n\n* My school had a \"religious release time\" that you could go to a \"seminary course,\" (translation, mormons want you to go to church every day! Fun for everyone.) I slept/ditched most of it. When it was finally my day to give the \"opening prayer\" I showed up in a trenchcoat and thanked god for sparing us the in-breeding problems of Adam and Eve's kids not having anyone else to have sex with. That was the day I was asked not to come back. \n\n* Oh, my personal favorite. I collaborated with the AP European History teacher, and got class participation to sneak all of the stuff out of our AP US History teacher's classroom while she was out. I mean, desks, paintings, books, everything. She came back at the end of class and we were all sitting cross-legged in \"our spots.\"  \n\nMe and my group of friends were \"those kids\" in school. I almost miss it. \n\nThen I remember that for April Fools this year, I took the Windows startup sound, added 6 minutes of dead air, then added two minutes of \"Sasha Grey getting fucked in the ass\" moaning, and replaced my coworker's startup sound mp3 with that.

Never got fingered for that one, though they &amp;quot;knew.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Used the plastic mold-maker in shop class to make a penis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spray-painted a penis on the dent door of another kid in shop class because &amp;quot;you have to give it a fresh paint job as part of the assignment anyway.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In geography, one cute thing they teach you is that if you look at a &lt;a href=\"http://www.yourchildlearns.com/online-atlas/images/map-of-united-states-2.gif\"&gt;US map&lt;/a&gt; Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Arkansas and Louisiana all kind of look like a little man, and it&amp;#39;s an easy way to remember the states along the Mississippi river. Someone helpfully pointed out that Kentucky made it look like he was holding a chicken leg. The teacher liked that. I pointed out that Tennessee looked like his boner. The teacher did not like that as much. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kicked out of gym class for exploring the cold-war tunnels under the school that connected to a maintenance door by the boy&amp;#39;s locker room. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Told the home Ec teacher I didn&amp;#39;t need her course because I planned &amp;quot;to do more with my life than be a housewife.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Went to my teacher&amp;#39;s computer, created a folder labeled &amp;quot;horse porn&amp;quot; took a screenshot, made that the desktop background and deleted the folder. Teacher spent a good 5 minutes freaking out and trying to get rid of it. Didn&amp;#39;t get kicked out on condition of fixing it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dressed as the Goblin King from Labyrinth one Halloween. Apparently codpieces are discouraged in high school. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Was told to stop running DDoS attacks against teachers I didn&amp;#39;t like in my Java programming class. Think the teacher may have been secretly proud about that one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;My school had a &amp;quot;religious release time&amp;quot; that you could go to a &amp;quot;seminary course,&amp;quot; (translation, mormons want you to go to church every day! Fun for everyone.) I slept/ditched most of it. When it was finally my day to give the &amp;quot;opening prayer&amp;quot; I showed up in a trenchcoat and thanked god for sparing us the in-breeding problems of Adam and Eve&amp;#39;s kids not having anyone else to have sex with. That was the day I was asked not to come back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, my personal favorite. I collaborated with the AP European History teacher, and got class participation to sneak all of the stuff out of our AP US History teacher&amp;#39;s classroom while she was out. I mean, desks, paintings, books, everything. She came back at the end of class and we were all sitting cross-legged in &amp;quot;our spots.&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me and my group of friends were &amp;quot;those kids&amp;quot; in school. I almost miss it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I remember that for April Fools this year, I took the Windows startup sound, added 6 minutes of dead air, then added two minutes of &amp;quot;Sasha Grey getting fucked in the ass&amp;quot; moaning, and replaced my coworker&amp;#39;s startup sound mp3 with that. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d39me61", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1463562782.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1463533982.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 55}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4jsxgf", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4jsxgf", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d39djyd", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "holytriplem", "parent_id": "t1_d39dc7b", "score": 5, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I did that once in a university lecture in front of 250 people.
