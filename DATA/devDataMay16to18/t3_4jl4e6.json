So I drew a bunch of hockey players all shaking hands, and the US flag, and having no idea what the West German flag looked like, but with a recent field trip to Lakehurst NJ where the Hindenburg crashed still fresh in my mind, I knew what the German flag from back in the 30&amp;#39;s looked like, so I drew that as well. So my drawing that I turned in to Mrs. Silverstein was a bunch of guys shaking hands in front of the US flag and a Nazi swastika. I remember being quite confused when my parents had to bring me to meet with the teacher and a vice principal to discuss the inappropriateness of my drawing. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d37jqgj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1463440430.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1463411630.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1311}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4jl4e6", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4jl4e6", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4jl4e6", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 9, "parent_id": "t1_d381ra6", "id": "d38og8i", "name": "t1_d38og8i", "children": ["d38og8i", "d38le4v", "d38v3kd", "d38gzvh", "d38gscd"]}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d381ra6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TheCosmicCoasta", "parent_id": "t1_d37vodn", "score": 265, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "My mother was not known for her talent in the kitchen.
