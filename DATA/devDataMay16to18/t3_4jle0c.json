There is a very large spectrum of what is classified as a catcall ranging from vulgarly detailed descriptions of what they want to do to you to less intrusive passing comments, jokes or sounds. And as the person above me pointed out, how these sounds or comments are delivered makes a huge difference. I don&amp;#39;t think they should all be grouped together because they are not the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also I think there is this stigma where sometimes anything a guy says about appearance is seen as creepy. One time a woman I didn&amp;#39;t know came up to me in a locker room and said something nice about my appearance. And that is a way more intrusive situation (I was changing) than a man saying something on the street. But if I man comes up to you on the street and says &amp;quot;you have pretty eyes&amp;quot; suddenly it&amp;#39;s super offensive. Both situations were unsolicited contact, but I feel it&amp;#39;d be more common for the guy to get told he&amp;#39;s a creep because there is this assumption that he&amp;#39;s saying it to try and get in your pants. I think that attitude is a bit presumptuous. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d37l5vu", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1463442511.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1463413711.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d37j2ve", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "KyleHooks", "parent_id": "t1_d37iq4j", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "To me, there's a very big difference between a whistle by itself and any sexual comments that follow.
