This was mainly so the teacher could sit at one station the whole class, connect to a student's station, listen, and then chime in and help them. Everyone had headphones and microphones. It helped because then you could interact with students without interrupting anyone else. You could remind them of certain techniques that could improve their play without drawing anyone's attention...so it worked on a whole different level of being able to talk to students about their errors without embarrassing them. You could also, and here's the important part, connect two pianos together so each student could hear the other one and talk. They could play pieces together. It's pretty cool.\n\nIn comes Theo. I'll call him Theo because that was his name. I'd often connect to his station and he wouldn't be doing anything. I had to constantly remind him to keep working. The thing was, Theo actually had a fan-fucking-tastic ear. The kid grew up in the church jamming with his friends for hours each week. Whenever he played without music he was very very good. His playing had such nuance and the embellishments he would add were advanced. He could play at a similar level to me, and I have a degree in Music Education. I've taken piano lessons for many years at that point. When you made Theo read music, though, he got very confused. Now, some might say Theo passes that class hands down, but I'd remind you that part of the class is actually learning to read music. There were tests to identify rhythms, name notes, etc. It was a big component of the class. Other students were graded on this, why wouldn't Theo be held to the same standard? Another important point of this story is that Theo could have probably just memorized everything and fooled me, but he didn't want to put that much work in. He said, \"Fuck it I'll do it live\" every time.\n\nDuring our final exam ([Charlie Brown Christmas Theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQybajU2GNk)), each student played for the class. Consider it like a recital. I would put their piano on speaker and the class would be the audience. It's Theo's turn, and he needs to do well on this because he has been failing/not doing the written work. Before he starts he asks me if I'll come check some random setting on his piano. He was like \"Mr. Telestrial..my low notes ain't comin' out!\" Which actually happened from time to time. All the kids knew what to do, though. You just flick the keyboard off and on in the back and viola--fixed. Theo didn't do that and kept complaining, so I quickly walked over and did it for him.\n\nThis is where Theo's friend, Xavious comes in. Xavious went to my station while my back was turned and wired his keyboard to Theo's headset. I fix Theo's keyboard and stand off to the side. Theo starts in and it's very very good. He's getting everything right. He starts at a great tempo. The bass is clear. The right hand is coming through nicely. He's jamming. The class, knowing Theo's struggle, begins to murmur in affirmation. Theo turns around while he's playing and that's when I noticed his head kind of bobbing up and down.....like you do when you're listening to music. It dawns on me. I look across the class and see Xavious hard at work. Staring at his book and playing. He turns to see me and stops...and so does Theo.\n\nXavious was playing the piece for Theo, and Theo was, by ear alone, transcribing it in his head and playing it for the class. I mean fuck me..I couldn't even do that. There are college classes that last 4 semesters about being able to hear and transcribe at that level. Let alone to be hearing it slightly ahead, transcribe, and put your fingers where they need to be.\n\nGod damn. I felt bad forcing him to retake it during his lunch hour and having to fail him. I know Reddit wants that feel good ending but...yeah. The class is about reading music, and Theo never put forth the effort to do that. In fact, with his skills in piano, he had a hypothetical shorter path to passing the class than any other student. Most were learning to read music and learning to play the piano. He just had one component, and he wasn't willing to put in the time. Still, one of my favorite cheating stories because it was so elaborate. \n\n**TL;DR Piano Class at HS level. Kid wires his piano to another's headphones and the other kid actively transcribes and performs the final in real time with the whole class watching.**\n\nEDIT: For those asking about Xavious, I had a conversation with him about it and his reasoning was he was helping a friend. I made it clear that I could report him to the office for academic honesty and sort of scared him a bit. I let him sweat for about ten minutes, but I ultimately let him go. I moved schools but the rest of the time I was there I'd always see him in the hallway and we would exchange nods. As for Theo, he ended up failing the class and I think he was put on academic probation for it. I see a lot of replies of \"but he's so good. You must reward it!\" I tend to disagree for multiple reasons. Chiefly, how many people do you know with extraordinary talent but who fail at applying themselves?
