And really overall was not that bad, but the bad parts where just so bad. The little delay in combat strikes completely defeated the point of mapping attacks to the stick. There was no fast paced combat anymore. Make combat seamless, quick. Add a little depth with combos and moves mapped to different stick movements. Camera was terrible too, should&amp;#39;ve been zoomed farther out, instead of locked to the characters ass. Similar to the X Men Legends camera would have made combat from all sides easy to view. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those two changes would&amp;#39;ve made the game playable, good even. I can&amp;#39;t believe no one saw this coming. Although they probably did and then Dyack fired them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The lore of that game was very interesting. I would have really loved the trilogy that turned into, but the first installment was such a turd it never came to be&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d38jkvn", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1463498699.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1463469899.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d38j79j", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Zon800", "parent_id": "t3_4jpjnn", "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Too Human.\n\nThe first level was fun, after that it went downhill fast.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too Human.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first level was fun, after that it went downhill fast.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d38j79j", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1463497439.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1463468639.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4jpjnn", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d38jb6e", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "oakley56fila", "parent_id": "t3_4jpjnn", "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "One of the many Facebook farming simulators.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the many Facebook farming simulators.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d38jb6e", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1463497796.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1463468996.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4jpjnn", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4jpjnn", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d38w7k0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Barajiqal", "parent_id": "t1_d38jldq", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "That fight seemed like it took an hour, I had to check how long the video was because nothing was happening except some flashes of color.

Playing songs is only possible when they're programmed in, and most of the instruments have a mind of their own when I'm attempting to use the crappy motion controls. Even some of the drums feel unresponsive to movement, and they're the only thing I can rely on to make a good sound.\n\nBut you know what makes me more disappointed than anything? It's how much potential it had.
