He spends a few happy years at Hogwarts where he makes three close friends, but immediately loses all his friends within 2-3 years of of graduation. He loses his mother during that first war as well. He always has to leave his jobs before they find out he's a werewolf. If he doesn't have anyone to make Wolfsbane for him, he loses his human mind each transformation, so he lives in terror of accidentally killing someone when he's out of control. He loathes/fears his condition so much that his boggart is the full moon, and he can't bear to produce a corporeal patronus because his takes the form of a wolf, and anything wolfish reminds him of his condition. During the second war he has to go undercover among werewolves shunned from society, some of whom are lead by the very same man who bit Lupin as a child.
