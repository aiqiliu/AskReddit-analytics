I actually got lucky cause she was too drunk to notice and we carried on making out through the night. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like I said, I really liked this girl, and I was really drunk, so later that night I message my friends at home saying &amp;#39;we kissed enough for it to be official, it was quite passionate&amp;#39;. I must have thought I was Shakespeare or something. To this day a football team at my uni is named after that text (Quite Passionate Rangers, like Queens Park Rangers). Even my friends parents and their parents colleagues know the story. After every night out if my friend gets with someone they ask me if it was passionate enough. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t even see the girl again, apparently it wasn&amp;#39;t enough to be official after all. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2qfbnd", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462266064.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462237264.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hjwoc", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2qhqwi", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "divaboots", "parent_id": "t3_4hjwoc", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "My ex and I got caught by a random bystander having anal behind a dumpster near his friend's apartment, both wasted as fuck.
