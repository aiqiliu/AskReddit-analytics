It&amp;#39;s the first non-prompted question he&amp;#39;d asked. I say, &amp;quot;Oh yeah, like it. My favorite movie is the first one. The other two got a bit repetitive with the battles.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s silent for a moment. &amp;quot;Lord of the Rings are my favorite movies ever. And the books as well.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I read the books too,&amp;quot; I reply conversationally. &amp;quot;They weren&amp;#39;t bad but not my favorites.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s silent again. &amp;quot;Lord of the Rings is very important to me.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a little confused now. &amp;quot;I like them, they&amp;#39;re just not my all time favorite thing, you know?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another long pause. His stare is oddly intense. &amp;quot;Lord of the Rings is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; important to me, and it&amp;#39;s very important to me that you like it too.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well, you know,&amp;quot; I say slowly, a bit cautious, &amp;quot;we don&amp;#39;t have to have exactly matching interests to be compatible. And I do like Lord of the Rings, I&amp;#39;m just not super passionate about it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That strangely cutting stare intensifies. &amp;quot;... It&amp;#39;s REALLY  important to me that you like Lord of the Rings.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point I simply shrugged and resumed browsing, but let me tell you, I wrapped that date up fast and lost his number immediately. Luckily, my lack of intense passion for LotR was enough of a turnoff that he didn&amp;#39;t try for a second date.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know exactly what kind of bullet I dodged there but I definitely dodged something.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2qtlel", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462296779.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462267979.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1174}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hkuuw", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hkuuw", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 12, "parent_id": "t1_d2qu53k", "children": ["d2rd6yp", "d2rv5yd", "d2rb41t", "d2rb4r3", "d2rpuwh", "d2rxv14", "d2rn28s", "d2r923i"], "name": "t1_d2rd6yp", "id": "d2rd6yp"}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2qu53k", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "parent_id": "t1_d2qs02e", "score": 414, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "[deleted]", "edited": 1462468611.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[deleted]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2qu53k", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462298975.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462270175.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 414}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hkuuw", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 3, "parent_id": "t1_d2qt8r6", "children": ["d2qzkg0"], "name": "t1_d2qzkg0", "id": "d2qzkg0"}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2qt8r6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Joelico95", "parent_id": "t1_d2qs02e", "score": 281, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "\u0ca0_\u0ca0", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u0ca0_\u0ca0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2qt8r6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462295378.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462266578.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 281}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hkuuw", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 12, "parent_id": "t1_d2qy7eu", "children": ["d2rm5tx", "d2rs9gn", "d2xf79l", "d2qz3qq", "d2r6s3e", "d2r9z5n"], "name": "t1_d2rm5tx", "id": "d2rm5tx"}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2qy7eu", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Wtfisthatkid", "parent_id": "t1_d2qs02e", "score": 72, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "not gonna lie, I've done this a few times.

This was during my first year in Uni.\n\nWent on a couple dates with a guy that seemed pretty nice. Very good looking guy who approached me so I decided to see how it would go. He tried being a gentleman, you know, holding the door and putting on my coat -- not too hung up on that sort of thing, just relax and be yourself. \n\nAnyway, After the third date he was trying to really rush into the physical and I was in no hurry. I had to pretty much tell him to back it up. I didn't know enough about him to really trust the guy like that yet. After that date he started constantly texting me at all hours, and would get irritated if I didn't message back. If I didn't write back he'd be demanding where I was and what I was doing. I was pissed off. He did this in the early morning that I had to go to work and it was the last straw. I was very straight and curt. I told him he needed to back off and chill out and his response was, \"_______, I think I'm in love with you.\"\n\nI was flabbergasted. I texted back \"I have no idea how you can think that, because you have barely gotten to know me, and I hardly know you.\"\n\nHe wrote back that it was an accidental butt text. That's . . . some pretty elaborate and skillful butt texting.\n\nThe barrage of texts continued at all hours with increasing creepy desperation. WHY AREN'T YOU ANSWERING. I THOUGHT YOU WERE THE ONE AND YOU CAN'T EVEN TEXT OR CALL THAT IS MESSED UP. I demanded he delete my number and stop contacting me because he was scaring me. \n\nHe called me roughly five times and texted another night at 3 am. I had to be up for 6 for work. I just lost it. I told him his behavior was disturbing and that I truly thought he needed help, but I really didn't know him enough to be at the receiving end of this. He apologized profusely and said he had accidentally called my phone. I didn't hear from him for about a month and a half when suddenly he started writing me on facebook, commenting on all my pics. I blocked him and reported him. He started sending me emails that I 100% ignored: I can't stop thinking about you. Sometimes I see you around and it kills me that I fucked up my chances with you, you're such a decent person but it's pretty fucked up how you handled things.\n\nThe people I worked with started noticing a guy had started sitting outside of the workplace and when I finally saw the guy out on the bench a knot of fear was in my guts. It was him looking for me. He started texting as soon as he saw that I'd seen him and I told him I was done. I told him he was stalking and that if I saw or heard from him one more time, I was going to go to the police.\n\nI didn't hear from him again for almost half a year and by that time I had just started dating this really nice guy who was a drummer. I went downtown to see one of his shows and we were both standing outside having a smoke. Out of the alley, out of NOWHERE, comes YOU KNOW FUCKING WHO. He puts his arm around me, looks the new guy I'm dating up and down and says: Well, who is this? You never told me about him. I just stormed back into the pub horrified and new guy came in and asked me about the guy, who never followed us.\n\nThat was the last I saw of him, but I still get creeped out walking anywhere alone sometimes.\n\nGet this . . . about two years later I was living in an all girls house and one of my new roommates who had just moved to my city had started seeing a guy . . . she showed me a pic and I nearly lost my mind. IT WAS HIM. And lo and behold, he started doing the SAME thing to her. \n\nTL;DR: This guy seemed normal for two and a half dates, and then spiraled into a level 9000 creep like you wouldn't believe.

He puts his arm around me, looks the new guy I&amp;#39;m dating up and down and says: Well, who is this? You never told me about him. I just stormed back into the pub horrified and new guy came in and asked me about the guy, who never followed us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was the last I saw of him, but I still get creeped out walking anywhere alone sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Get this . . . about two years later I was living in an all girls house and one of my new roommates who had just moved to my city had started seeing a guy . . . she showed me a pic and I nearly lost my mind. IT WAS HIM. And lo and behold, he started doing the SAME thing to her. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: This guy seemed normal for two and a half dates, and then spiraled into a level 9000 creep like you wouldn&amp;#39;t believe. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2qjr44", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462272369.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462243569.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2667}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hkuuw", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hkuuw", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hkuuw", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hkuuw", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2r30mv", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ThrowAwayAcct0000", "parent_id": "t1_d2qtdcl", "score": 100, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "After reading her post, I think you're totally right.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;After reading her post, I think you&amp;#39;re totally right.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2r30mv", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462317268.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462288468.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 100}}, {"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 2, "parent_id": "t1_d2qtdcl", "id": "d2rol8k", "name": "t1_d2rol8k", "children": ["d2rol8k", "d2rp77q"]}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2qtdcl", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "naribela", "parent_id": "t1_d2qr3cg", "score": 561, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "He hates giving people free meter time, duh.

Now, Aleisha is generously-proportioned herself, but makes sure her photos clearly show this. His photos, however, had to have been at least two or three years old. He orders the two of them a bottle of wine, and they order dinner. He finishes his glass of wine before the obligatory bread sticks even come out, then pours himself another glass of wine and tries to play a drinking game with her,  'never have I ever' style, in the middle of the restaurant with just the two of them. Aleisha laughs it off and goes to the bathroom where she frantically calls me telling me I need to save her. So I call her five minutes later and saved her.\n\n\nShe called me from her car (having been 'accompanied' to the carpark by him and then driving away as fast as possible) from a random street. She said when she said she needed to leave, he finished off her wine as quickly as possible and then realised he'd 'forgotten' his wallet and she had to pay for the whole thing, even though he had told her he'd pay for it all beforehand. She always offers to pay for half of her dinner dates but when someone explicitly says it's 'their treat' and they'll pay, you kind of don't expect to end up paying for the whole thing?\n\n\nMakes me so glad I'm gay.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not my story, but my best friend&amp;#39;s story that&amp;#39;s so ridiculous it&amp;#39;s amazing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I met my fiancee on Tinder, which inspired my best friend - Aleisha - to give Tinder a go.
