He also tried and failed to go after my sisters, who were in the house at the time.\n\nIn retrospect, our entire family suffers from some degree of mental disorder. He was the one who suffered the most from it, and in retrospect there were a lot of things that could have prevented what happened. Our dad ended up offing himself after he turned abusive towards our mom and she moved to get a divorce. We were all pretty young, and my brother was only 2 so he grew up without a father. Our mom always had to work to provide for all of us, so we were left to our own devices for the most part.\n\nMy sisters and I would always treat him pretty poorly, it started off as just being directed towards the youngest sibling, and grew from there into us always having a strained relationship. My youngest sister always got into spats with him, he or she would always instigate arguments with one another. In time he ended up growing isolated, and was always the odd one out. He was hard to get along with, and inherited our dad's short temper and stubbornness.\n\nWhen puberty hit, his mental health got worse. He became more and more argumentative, and he became louder and more threatening. At one point my mom ended up committing him to a children's psych ward for a time. She was convinced that my father suffered from schizophrenia, and that my brother had inherited that. In retrospect, I think it was truly a combination of anxiety, depression, and ADHD, all exacerbated by his upbringing.\n\nSome time passed, and at one point my mom found that someone had broke into our basement. Nothing was stolen, but that was incentive enough for her to purchase a gun for self-defense. I don't remember the details, but at one point she gave him access to the key to the gun safe and forgot to take it back. One night he was being incredibly hard to deal with, she was at work and he was texting her and being a dick. She made the mistake of texting him flat out that she was going to have to commit him again. I still don't know why she made that decision. He had said before he would kill himself before going back.\n\nThat night she went back home and everything was seemingly normal. At some point he brought the gun out of his room and shot and killed her in the kitchen. My sisters were headed upstairs and ran and hid in their rooms, locking the doors. He went upstairs to kill them as well, but tried and failed to shoot the locks (it was a .22 pistol, the door knobs were filled with holes, but he didn't get in). I am still thankful that he gave up after failing to shoot them open, he could've have kicked open those doors with no trouble, but didn't think to do so.\n\nOne sister escaped out of her window, but slipped on her way off the roof and broke her back, leaving her as a paraplegic. The other waited things out in her room until it was safe to leave and escape through the other sister's bedroom. The police were already there at that point and brought her a ladder to get down safely.\n\nIn the meantime, my brother had gone and shot himself in the bathroom. After some time, the SWAT team threw tear gas grenades through most of the windows and then breached the house, finding the bodies and bringing a close to the night's violence.\n\nI was in my apartment in another town, as I was away for college. I woke up that night to someone hammering on the apartment call button for my unit, but I ignored it as I figured it was one of my idiot friends. Then someone had let them into the building and I heard them hammering on my door. Imagine my surprise to find 3 police officers at my door in the middle of the night. I thought I was caught, my apartment reeked of marijuana as I had just smoked a bowl earlier in the day, and I was still a minor.\n\nTurns out they weren't there for the pot, but to tell me that my mom had died. They did not give me more details than that, not that my brother had died or that he was behind it all. My younger sister had told them not to fill me in all at once, as I had to make my way down and she was worried that I would be too emotionally charged to drive safely in the snow. In the end the police drove me to my friends' house and they took me down to my home town, where I learned all the grisly details. I met with my younger sister and we stayed the night at her boyfriends' family's house. We laid in bed crying and talking until the sun came up, then we watched cartoons with the family's dogs in a light-hearted moment amidst the turmoil.\n\nI think I'll end the story there. There was a lot that could have changed the way things turned out, but of course that is all in hindsight. Life doesn't allow us do-overs, so we've just had to keep moving forward with what has been handed to us.\n\nI know this will probably be buried, but I never catch these threads in time to do otherwise.\n\n---\n\nEdit: Wow, so much for the post being buried! I don't have much time before I have to get ready for work, but I wanted to say thank you for the outpouring of support. It means a lot to me and I am glad to have been able to get this off of my chest.\n\n---\n\nEDIT 2: Okay! I think I've gone through and responded or upvoted most everyone who left a reply!

For some reason I'm super terrified anyone will know who I'm talking about, even though this happened in a small town in not-America, so here is the short version;\n\nHe always struggled socially, he did have some mental problems, and was for a year or so taken away from normal school and put into a special programme. Which he hated.\n\nBut about a full year prior to the murder, he changed a lot. He was in his adolescent years, and his eyes were opened to all the terrors out in the world, wars and such. It bothered him a lot. He would often talk about these kind of things, about recent mass murders and such, tragedies. He hated it, and he really wanted to do something. That's why he killed, he needed to know what it was like. He wanted to go and fight terrorists as soon as he finished school. He knew a classmate who walked through the woods on his way home, so he hid and waited for him, and jumped out and stabbed him as he walked past. He said he panicked when the victim started screaming, so he stabbed him over and over and over again. \n\n**edit:** the reason I was feeling uncomfortable sharing too much information, was becuase I wasn't sure I was the best to \"present his case\" (even though I followed the court case and read all his statements), and if this strictly was my information to post on the internet like this. Not because I'm the killer in this story, but was never caught, as a few have suggested.\n\nAnyways, please refrain from making assumptions based on what little info you know. He didn't just make up the terrorist things as an excuse to kill, he really did want to fight terrorists. Following the arrest, the police announced they had been monitoring him, as he had contacted the police, requesting they ship him out to a country, can't remember which, where he could fight terrorists. He contacted the police rather than the military, as he knew for sure there was no chance with his mental problems, plus he knew he would be required to go through training.

For some reason I&amp;#39;m super terrified anyone will know who I&amp;#39;m talking about, even though this happened in a small town in not-America, so here is the short version;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He always struggled socially, he did have some mental problems, and was for a year or so taken away from normal school and put into a special programme. Which he hated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But about a full year prior to the murder, he changed a lot. He was in his adolescent years, and his eyes were opened to all the terrors out in the world, wars and such. It bothered him a lot. He would often talk about these kind of things, about recent mass murders and such, tragedies. He hated it, and he really wanted to do something. That&amp;#39;s why he killed, he needed to know what it was like. He wanted to go and fight terrorists as soon as he finished school. He knew a classmate who walked through the woods on his way home, so he hid and waited for him, and jumped out and stabbed him as he walked past. He said he panicked when the victim started screaming, so he stabbed him over and over and over again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;edit:&lt;/strong&gt; the reason I was feeling uncomfortable sharing too much information, was becuase I wasn&amp;#39;t sure I was the best to &amp;quot;present his case&amp;quot; (even though I followed the court case and read all his statements), and if this strictly was my information to post on the internet like this. Not because I&amp;#39;m the killer in this story, but was never caught, as a few have suggested.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, please refrain from making assumptions based on what little info you know. He didn&amp;#39;t just make up the terrorist things as an excuse to kill, he really did want to fight terrorists. Following the arrest, the police announced they had been monitoring him, as he had contacted the police, requesting they ship him out to a country, can&amp;#39;t remember which, where he could fight terrorists. He contacted the police rather than the military, as he knew for sure there was no chance with his mental problems, plus he knew he would be required to go through training. He was also gay, and seeing the way gays were treated in different countries really angered him as well. He knew of several terrorist groups who specifically targeted gay people. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2op8x4", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462158236.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462129436.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2135}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4ha0er", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4ha0er", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2p00sb", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "2OQuestions", "parent_id": "t1_d2otzi9", "score": 68, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Since you were young, you may have been shielded from red flags, or may not have noticed them.
