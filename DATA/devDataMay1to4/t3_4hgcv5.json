Why? Seriously. Again, I point back to COD4, which had a sneaking section which is universally beloved by players, and it didn't have button prompts. Why dumb it down? We might make fun of the 14 year old COD playerbase, but I've watched kids play these games- they can figure that stuff out. \n\nThe actual QTEs are also something that has become a terribly too common part of the games. They aren't even reserved for special events anymore either. The thing about QTEs is that they are needed for when your character is doing something far outside their normal set of moves- but if I'm playing a shooter, I have to ask do I want to be doing things outside my normal moveset all the time, or do I want to be shooting? Let's look at the end of COD4 vs. the end of COD:MW3. So in COD4, you are fighting a pretty tough last stand, and your character is immobilized, the bad guy is bearing down on you, and all is lost until an NPC tosses you a gun. You have it with the bad guy in your sights. No QTE, no button prompt, no helpful Clippy in the corner with a suggestion. It's an FPS and you know what to do. And you have full control of both aiming and shooting. You can shoot the bad guy first, or shoot his henchmen first, which might not sound huge, but it just hits home that it is *you* doing the action, not a separated character. You did it, you overcame the odds and won! In COD:MW3, you burst into a villain's building while wearing practically impenetrable armor and easily mow down everybody in front of you. Then you push a few QTE buttons as your wicked awesome player character snatches autonomy from you and hangs the guy. It's neat? I guess. Not a fulfilling boss fight though. \n\nThere are too many \u201cforced walking\u201d sections which are notionally gameplay, but really just a clumsy way to make sure the player is in the right place to see a setpiece. \n***\nGetting to weapon design, both in terms of game mechanics and visual design, the games put much less thought into how everything balances, and instead just throw more and more choices at you until the choices don't matter. I am primarily talking about SP, but most of my following thoughts could apply to MP. I feel strongly that in a shooter, the guns need to have distinctness from each other in a mechanical sense and each should add to the setting being portrayed. After all, you spend 99% of the game with one on your screen, so in a way they are the most important characters of all. \n\nWhen you have 10+ assault rifles and a number more SMGs which are functionally the same as the assault rifles in a game, and they all use the same mechanics, things quickly turn into a blur. Every weapon should have a distinct nook and there should be as few duplicates as possible. Why have an M16, XCR, ACR, XM8, etc in the same game if they are all basically the same? Weed out the doubles, and then crank up the differences between what\u2019s left. In addition to the base stats, weapons in modern shooters start to feel very samey when they are all using the same sights and scopes. If you have a red dot on two different FPS guns, and you spend 90% of the time looking through it, is using either gun really a different experience form the other? Now, I know that in real life rails make using the same scopes for everything possible and easy, but games, especially COD aren\u2019t mimicking real life. This is partially why I was excited that COD: Black Ops was using a Vietnam setting, since that would have been a perfect pretext to really emphasize the distinction between a smaller pool of weapons (a low recoil, 20 round M16 vs. a high recoil, high climb AK for a simple start), with the weapons mostly using iron sights to give a visual distinction. Because when you think of Vietnam, you think of soldiers running around with M16s with iron sights and the funny looking tiny magazines right? This is why I was sorely disappointed when COD: BLOPs made the default weapon a flattop rifle with a red dot, and where most of the weapons you pick up off the enemy are a variety of nonsense weapons with modern type scopes on them. (Anybody trying to ding me on history stuff may mention that red dots did exist. And that\u2019s true, they did. But they looking nothing like in COD: BLOPS and they were neither common, nor do they evoke the imagery associated with the war). This is just an example, but it applies to the other weapons in the games.\n\nBattlefield Bad Company 2: Vietnam DLC is a great example of something which commits more strongly to the setting and plays better for it. \n\n***\nThe stories in the games have gotten worse and worse. Again, I know it\u2019s \u201cjust COD\u201d which should be a reason to lower standards, but really, the stories in COD1-3 were a decent mix of historical with Hollywood pop-history. COD4\u2019s story was fairly straight forward and it drew from enough real life inspiration to be at least as a decent as a mid-level Tom Clancy book. \n\nOne of the biggest mistakes has been moving away from playing as a normal grunt as a main character. That used to help ground the games, and it makes the sneaky Special Operations bits feel distinct and special. In COD4, you play as a normal Marine for big and loud sections, and then as SAS for sneaky sections. Both sections have differently designed levels. The Marine sections are during the day, loud, with rocking guitar music, and you\u2019re surrounded by masses of friendlies in pitched battle. The SAS sections encourage sneaking at least early on, you always start with a suppressed and upgraded rifle which lets you subconsciously know that you\u2019re playing as a Special Ops guy, most levels are at night, and the music tends to be more subdued.\n\nIn contrast, in COD: BLOPS you play as two different characters- a CIA badass, and a\u2026slightly older CIA badass. Not really very distinct. \n\nImagine in COD: BLOPS if you had instead played as a normal Army grunt and as a CIA badass. As the grunt, you\u2019re a normal guy with an NPC squad of Vietnam clich\u00e9 soldiers and you have stand up gunfights ripped straight out of popular movies while using a bunch of standard gear of the era. Then you switch over to playing as CIA badass to use funky high tech for 1970s gear as you sneak around behind enemy lines to do interesting things like kidnap Soviets or plant bugs in embassies. \n\nAnd the thing is, the COD stories keep getting bigger and more complex and it\u2019s just needless. Bigger doesn\u2019t mean more emotional or fulfilling (that\u2019s what she said). In COD4, most of the levels end with you just barely making to an escape helicopter while under fire. It\u2019s a small accomplishment, but it *feels* earned for the player. Yeah, as the SAS guy, you save the world from nuclear weapons, but it was a slow ramp up and the story was simple. In every COD since then, you\u2019re single handedly winning the war and saving the world from some insanely complex plot orchestrated by a cartoon villain. Why? Why can\u2019t you just be a part of a bigger history? A COD set in Vietnam could easily include traditional sections where as a soldier you save your squad and are a local hero, and other sections where as a CIA guy you do things that are could plausibly have happened without anybody ever knowing. \n***\nAs for the multiplayer, the single biggest issue is going to be those killstreaks. They are just plain unfair to use (all reward, no risk to them) and they are not well tailored for the maps. Nothing is worse than somebody getting an airstrike or something in a tiny map where you have nowhere to hide. Now, there was a game called Homefront which had awful, terrible single player. I can\u2019t emphasize how bad the SP was. But the system it used in multiplayer for \u201ckillstreaks\u201d was wonderful. First off, the killstreaks were restricted on a map by map basis to make sure nothing horribly unfair was possible to use. The maps over the course of the game would slowly open up (think similar to how rush maps in BFBC2 open up) and more killstreaks would become available. This had the effect of winning players having to chose between using their points early for small streaks, or waiting for the maps to open up to buy bigger streaks- and hopefully once the maps opened up at least one person on each team could buy one big item, which balanced things out.\n\nThen, the killstreaks were activated by earning enough in-game points in a match, and this could be done from not just kills, but also from spotting enemies for the team or completing objectives (this is something COD has played with) and the points stayed through death, which meant that even bad players had a chance to buy a rocket launcher to defend themselves from the strong players using tanks.\nIt was overall much less frustrating while still keeping the chaotic feel of a COD match. \n\n***\nI missed a bunch of stuff, but that\u2019s a start of my complaints. \n", "edited": 1462212678.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;crouch or go prone. Why? Seriously. Again, I point back to COD4, which had a sneaking section which is universally beloved by players, and it didn&amp;#39;t have button prompts. Why dumb it down? We might make fun of the 14 year old COD playerbase, but I&amp;#39;ve watched kids play these games- they can figure that stuff out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The actual QTEs are also something that has become a terribly too common part of the games. They aren&amp;#39;t even reserved for special events anymore either. The thing about QTEs is that they are needed for when your character is doing something far outside their normal set of moves- but if I&amp;#39;m playing a shooter, I have to ask do I want to be doing things outside my normal moveset all the time, or do I want to be shooting? Let&amp;#39;s look at the end of COD4 vs. the end of COD:MW3. So in COD4, you are fighting a pretty tough last stand, and your character is immobilized, the bad guy is bearing down on you, and all is lost until an NPC tosses you a gun. You have it with the bad guy in your sights. No QTE, no button prompt, no helpful Clippy in the corner with a suggestion. It&amp;#39;s an FPS and you know what to do. And you have full control of both aiming and shooting. You can shoot the bad guy first, or shoot his henchmen first, which might not sound huge, but it just hits home that it is &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; doing the action, not a separated character. You did it, you overcame the odds and won! In COD:MW3, you burst into a villain&amp;#39;s building while wearing practically impenetrable armor and easily mow down everybody in front of you. Then you push a few QTE buttons as your wicked awesome player character snatches autonomy from you and hangs the guy. It&amp;#39;s neat? I guess. Not a fulfilling boss fight though. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are too many \u201cforced walking\u201d sections which are notionally gameplay, but really just a clumsy way to make sure the player is in the right place to see a setpiece. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Getting to weapon design, both in terms of game mechanics and visual design, the games put much less thought into how everything balances, and instead just throw more and more choices at you until the choices don&amp;#39;t matter. I am primarily talking about SP, but most of my following thoughts could apply to MP. I feel strongly that in a shooter, the guns need to have distinctness from each other in a mechanical sense and each should add to the setting being portrayed.
