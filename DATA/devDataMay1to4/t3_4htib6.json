After giving it some thought, I was reminded of a story that I had never shared before, and I relayed the following.\n\nI was flying the SR-71 out of RAF Mildenhall, England, with my back-seater, Walt Watson; we were returning from a mission over Europe and the Iron Curtain when we received a radio transmission from home base. As we scooted across Denmark in three minutes, we learned that a small RAF base in the English countryside had requested an SR-71 fly-past. The air cadet commander there was a former Blackbird pilot, and thought it would be a motivating moment for the young lads to see the mighty SR-71 perform a low approach. No problem, we were happy to do it. After a quick aerial refuelling over the North Sea, we proceeded to find the small airfield.\n\nWalter had a myriad of sophisticated navigation equipment in the back seat, and began to vector me toward the field. Descending to subsonic speeds, we found ourselves over a densely wooded area in a slight haze. Like most former WWII British airfields, the one we were looking for had a small tower and little surrounding infrastructure. Walter told me we were close and that I should be able to see the field, but I saw nothing. Nothing but trees as far as I could see in the haze. We got a little lower, and I pulled the throttles back from 325 knots we were at. With the gear up, anything under 275 was just uncomfortable. Walt said we were practically over the field-yet; there was nothing in my windscreen. I banked the jet and started a gentle circling maneuver in hopes of picking up anything that looked like a field. Meanwhile, below, the cadet commander had taken the cadets up on the catwalk of the tower in order to get a prime view of the fly-past. It was a quiet, still day with no wind and partial gray overcast. Walter continued to give me indications that the field should be below us but in the overcast and haze, I couldn\u2019t see it. The longer we continued to peer out the window and circle, the slower we got. With our power back, the awaiting cadets heard nothing. I must have had good instructors in my flying career, as something told me I better cross-check the gauges. As I noticed the airspeed indicator slide below 160 knots, my heart stopped and my adrenalin-filled left hand pushed two throttles full forward. At this point we weren\u2019t really flying, but were falling in a slight bank. Just at the moment that both afterburners lit with a thunderous roar of flame (and what a joyous feeling that was) the aircraft fell into full view of the shocked observers on the tower. Shattering the still quiet of that morning, they now had 107 feet of fire-breathing titanium in their face as the plane levelled and accelerated, in full burner, on the tower side of the infield, closer than expected, maintaining what could only be described as some sort of ultimate knife-edge pass.\n\nQuickly reaching the field boundary, we proceeded back to Mildenhall without incident. We didn\u2019t say a word for those next 14 minutes. After landing, our commander greeted us, and we were both certain he was reaching for our wings. Instead, he heartily shook our hands and said the commander had told him it was the greatest SR-71 fly-past he had ever seen, especially how we had surprised them with such a precise maneuver that could only be described as breathtaking. He said that some of the cadet\u2019s hats were blown off and the sight of the plan form of the plane in full afterburner dropping right in front of them was unbelievable. Walt and I both understood the concept of \u2018breathtaking\u2019 very well that morning and sheepishly replied that they were just excited to see our low approach.\n\nAs we retired to the equipment room to change from space suits to flight suits, we just sat there-we hadn\u2019t spoken a word since \u2018the pass.\u2019 Finally, Walter looked at me and said, \u2018One hundred fifty-six knots. What did you see?\u2019 Trying to find my voice, I stammered, \u2018One hundred fifty-two.\u2019 We sat in silence for a moment. Then Walt said, \u2018Don\u2019t ever do that to me again!\u2019 And I never did.\n\nA year later, Walter and I were having lunch in the Mildenhall Officer\u2019s club, and overheard an officer talking to some cadets about an SR-71 fly-past that he had seen one day. Of course, by now the story included kids falling off the tower and screaming as the heat of the jet singed their eyebrows. Noticing our HABU patches, as we stood there with lunch trays in our hands, he asked us to verify to the cadets that such a thing had occurred.

My gauges were wired in the left seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves, not only because I would soon be flying as a true pilot, but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months. Bumbling across the mountains 3,500 feet below us, I could only see the about 8 miles across the ground. I was, finally, after many humbling months of training and study, ahead of the plane.\nI was beginning to feel a bit sorry for my CFI in the right seat. There he was, with nothing to do except watch me and monitor two different radios. This wasn't really good practice for him at all. He'd been doing it for years. It had been difficult for me to relinquish control of the radios, as during my this part of my flying career, I could handle it on my own. But it was part of the division of duties on this flight and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground, however. My CFI was so good at many things, but he couldn't match my expertise at sounding awkward on the radios, a skill that had been roughly sharpened with years of listening to LiveATC.com where the slightest radio miscue was a daily occurrence. He understood that and allowed me that luxury.\n\n&gt;Just to get a sense of what my CFI had to contend with, I pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him. The predominant radio chatter was from Denver Center, not far below us, controlling daily traffic in our sector. While they had us on their scope (for a good while, I might add), we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to ascend into their airspace. We listened as the shaky voice of a lone SR-71 pilot asked Center for a readout of his ground speed. Center replied:\"Aspen 20, I show you at one thousand eight hundred and forty-two knots, across the ground.\" Now the thing to understand about Center controllers, was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna, or to Air Force One, they always spoke in the exact same, calm, deep, professional, tone that made one feel important. I referred to it as the \" Houston Center voice.\" I have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this country's space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the Houston controllers, that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that, and that they basically did. And it didn't matter what sector of the country we would be flying in, it always seemed like the same guy was talking. Over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere. Conversely, over the years, pilots always wanted to ensure that, when transmitting, they sounded like Chuck Yeager, or at least like John Wayne. Better to die than sound bad on the radios.\n\n&gt;Just moments after the SR-71's inquiry, an F-18 piped up on frequency, in a rather superior tone, asking for his ground speed. \"Dusty 52, Center, we have you at 620 on the ground.\" Boy, I thought, the F-18 really must think he is dazzling his SR-71 brethren. Then out of the blue, a Twin Beech pilot out of an airport outside of Denver came up on frequency. You knew right away it was a Twin Beech driver because he sounded very cool on the radios. \"Center, Beechcraft 173-Delta-Charlie ground speed check\". Before Center could reply, I'm thinking to myself, hey, that Beech probably has a ground speed indicator in that multi-thousand-dollar cockpit, so why is he asking Center for a readout? Then I got it, ol' Delta-Charlie here is making sure that every military jock from Mount Whitney to the Mojave knows what true speed is. He's the slowest dude in the valley today, and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new bug-smasher. And the reply, always with that same, calm, voice, with more distinct alliteration than emotion: \"173-Delta-Charlie, Center, we have you at 90 knots on the ground.\" And I thought to myself, is this a ripe situation, or what? As my hand instinctively reached for the mic button, I had to remind myself that my CFI was in control of the radios. Still, I thought, it must be done - in mere minutes we'll be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost. That Beechcraft must die, and die now. I thought about all of my training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming. I was torn. Somewhere, half a mile above Colorado, there was a pilot screaming inside his head. Then, I heard it. The click of the mic button from the right seat. That was the very moment that I knew my CFI and I had become a lifelong friends. Very professionally, and with no emotion, my CFI spoke: \"Denver Center, Cessna 56-November-Sierra, can you give us a ground speed check?\" There was no hesitation, and the replay came as if was an everyday request. \"Cessna 56-November-Sierra, I show you at 76 knots, across the ground.\"\n\n&gt;I think it was the six knots that I liked the best, so accurate and proud was Center to deliver that information without hesitation, and you just knew he was smiling. But the precise point at which I knew that my CFI and I were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say, in his most CFI-like voice: \"Ah, Center, much thanks, we're showing closer to 72 on the money.\"\n\n&gt;For a moment my CFI was a god. And we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the Houston Center voice, when Denver came back with, \"Roger that November-Sierra, your E6B is probably more accurate than our state-of-the-art radar. You boys have a good one.\"\n\n&gt;It all had lasted for just moments, but in that short, memorable stroll across the west, the Navy had been owned, all mortal airplanes on freq were forced to bow before the King of Slow, and more importantly, my CFI and I had crossed the threshold of being BFFs. A fine day's work. We never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to our home airport.\n\n&gt;For just one day, it truly was fun being the slowest guys out there.\n\nCredits to /u/DonnerPartyPicnic", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There were a lot of things we couldn&amp;#39;t do in an Cessna 172, but we were some of the slowest guys on the block and loved reminding our fellow aviators of this fact.

And we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the Houston Center voice, when L.A.came back with, &amp;quot;Roger that Aspen, Your equipment is probably more accurate than ours. You boys have a good one.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It all had lasted for just moments, but in that short, memorable sprint across the southwest, the Navy had been flamed, all mortal airplanes on freq were forced to bow before the King of Speed, and more importantly, Walter and I had crossed the threshold of being a crew. A fine day&amp;#39;s work. We never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to the coast.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For just one day, it truly was fun being the fastest guys out there.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2s9qnq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462388033.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462359233.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 409}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4htib6", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2sd6a4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "badmuther", "parent_id": "t3_4htib6", "score": 13, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "St Elmo's fire and arcing from the pitot boom to the canopy (looks like small flashes of lightening). \n\nThese phenomena happen when flying through precipitation at higher speeds.
