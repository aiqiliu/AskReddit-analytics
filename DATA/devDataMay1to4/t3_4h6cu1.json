(I was young forgive me, my teenage self was able to overlook many things.)\n\nAs most high school girls do, solely based on bad teen romance movies, I changed everything possible about myself to fit to what this guy was looking for.

I hung out weekly with\u2026 let\u2019s call her Raya, developing what seemed to her like a lifelong friendship and to me purely an opportunity. I learned from this new found friend things that this guy liked and found irresistible. That he enjoyed a challenge and was intrigued by women that knew what they wanted, also as became more and more problematic for me, he didn\u2019t date virgins.\n\nFinally at an end of summer party (I know, so not original), I decided it was time to make my move, my goal to thoroughly impress him. What can I say I couldn\u2019t do it, over the course of the evening I ignored the crap out of him, talked to his friends and danced most of the night away with Raya, until she disappeared to grab more booze. I lost track of him some time after Raya disappeared. Truthfully I gave up at that point, even started accepting that I liked my new found self and that maybe it was time for more obtainable goals.\n\nWhile waiting for my ride home outside on the porch, thoroughly trying to ignore the fact that his bike was still parked in the driveway, Raya appeared. She seemed a little depressed and I could tell she wasn\u2019t in the best of moods but I decided to ignore it and continued waiting in silence while she sat down to wait with me. When the taxi pulled up 15 minutes later she still hadn\u2019t said a word. I got up to say goodbye and walk to the car when she grabbed my hand and placed a small ripped piece of paper into it. \u201cIts his number, he said he\u2019d like to hear from you when you\u2019ve got time to go for coffee or something like that.\u201d And what did I have to say to the girl standing outside my taxi door, with makeup smears around her eyes from what I assume was crying, that just handed me her almost boyfriends number\u2026.. \u201cumm\u2026.Thanks I guess.\u201d I was officially the worst friend on earth at the moment.\n\nI did call him, two weeks later. We went out for coffee for our first date and actually had a pretty awesome night. I found out he was funny and he had a lot of dreams and goals that really weren\u2019t all that bad. He confessed he found me utterly confusing and wasn\u2019t sure whether I liked him or if I noticed him at all, then went on to tell me everything I wanted to hear about myself. That he couldn\u2019t stop staring at me that night at the party and that he found himself too nervous to come up and talk to me in front of all his friends\u2026..compliments, jokes, feeding my teenage need for approval.\n\nLater on we went back to his place under the guise of watching a movie or two. (Again I must say sorry for the clich\u00e9) One thing led to another and we ended up in bed (I will add a tiny twin bed\u2026.at his mother\u2019s house). Minutes into heavy groping he asked me pointe blank how many people I\u2019d slept with. I panicked and lied. We continued on\u2026..\n\nAfter all was done, me feeling as most when they lose their virginity. A little painful and a lot of shame. He decided it was time to tell me that he wasn\u2019t \u201cinto\u201d relationships, but that he\u2019d like to see me again. This uncomplicated no strings, \u201cjust sex\u201d relationship continued on for two years. It lasted longer than any relationship either of us had ever had.\n\nWe did become close friends in a very unhealthy way during this time period. We\u2019d talk to each other about people we liked and hoped we\u2019d end up dating, problems at home and work. Giving and taking relationship advice. We\u2019d have a lot of fights when one didn\u2019t agree with the other on something, calling each other or messaging or just showing up when we decided we would forgive the other, mostly just for sex and venting. I\u2019d just about forget that this whole thing started because I wanted to date him.\n\nThe last night we were together in my apartment after all the fun was over and we were having a shower he did drop the one bomb I was looking for back in high school. Soap still in my eyes he decided then after two years of this weird relationship that he would drop a question like. \u201cHey, would you ever date a guy like me? Like really date none of this nonexclusive shit?\u201d At that very moment I felt like I was back in high school, I felt giddy, happy and totally\u2026\u2026stupid. In less than 15 seconds I had gone through these emotions to end up at clarity.\n\nYes it was a relationship I wanted. No it was not with this overly tattooed man in front of me. (Who gets a tattoo of a smiling burger or a giant moth...) \u201cYou know I don\u2019t think we\u2019d make it as a couple. We\u2019d kill each other.

We were civil to each other and said pleasantries when we\u2019d see each other out at a bar or on a date. I\u2019d have a couple of weak moments and give him a call, he\u2019d do the same. He\u2019d say some shit about not finding someone like me and I\u2019d pretend that I didn\u2019t know what he was getting at. It took a lot not to fall back into that type of relationship with him.\n\nForward a few years later to now. We don\u2019t acknowledge each other at all. He\u2019s still looking for that relationship. I\u2019m happily celebrating my 4th anniversary. Passing each other in public we try not to look in each other\u2019s direction.
