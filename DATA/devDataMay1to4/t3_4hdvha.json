So after these issues I called the company like 20 times trying to get my internet fixed. Now I wasn&amp;#39;t happy at all but I understand shit happens. I said &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m pretty sure my modem is defective&amp;quot; all of the &amp;#39;level 3 techs&amp;#39; agreed saying they would send someone out. The guy comes out and try&amp;#39;s to tell me that my Wi-fi (that worked perfectly fine before the upgrade) would not work unless I put in an advanced router ($40), have an access point put into my bedroom ($30) blah blah blah. I asked him if he could please just try to change the modem out. He told me no and proceeded to mock me. I am normally very nice to customer service but I will not have someone come into my house and mock me. I called to request a different tech (I didn&amp;#39;t even complain. I just said &amp;quot;I felt the technician was rude. I don&amp;#39;t want to make a formal complaint because people have bad days, I would appreciate if you could send out a different tech&amp;quot; to which the lady assured me a DIFFERENT tech would be coming with a new modem.) Well they send the same guy. I was the bigger person, I let him in and he continued to be rude. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll put in the new modem, but I promise you you&amp;#39;re going to have the same fucking issue&amp;quot; He installs the new modem (Apparently the same model) and what do you know, the Wi-fi works. He might as well have sprinted out there. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the only real issue I have had with my cable company and it was enough of an issue that I would leave (After having them in this house for over 10 years). I am very decent to Customer service and technicians, but if there is one thing I don&amp;#39;t like it&amp;#39;s people being rude to me. Especially in my own home. I ultimately decided to stay with the company. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tl;dr: Cable guy was being stubborn and rude and it turns out that I was right. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2pgffs", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462210399.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462181599.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 74}}, {"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 11, "parent_id": "t1_d2pd8gy", "id": "d2pe7j6", "name": "t1_d2pe7j6", "children": ["d2pe7j6", "d2pttlv", "d2qlbdw", "d2pmvsb", "d2pwqrw", "d2pzufh", "d2pj9vz", "d2q9h8z", "d2pur17", "d2pf8qj", "d2pqok3"]}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2pd8gy", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "aGeordie", "parent_id": "t3_4hdvha", "score": 536, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "BT engineer came out to investigate noise on my line causing my broadband to go off.
