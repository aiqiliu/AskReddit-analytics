Here goes...\n\n* I don't know your living situation, but this will apply no matter what: **Don't study where you live**. There are just too many distractions and easy excuses to quit or not do it. Go to the library or any other building on campus where you are able to focus better. Experiment with a few to see what you like best. I live in a fraternity, and even though we are the top house campus for grades, it's still a fraternity and way harder to focus than our engineering building. It's worth the walk, no matter how far you go.\n* **Make it a part of your routine**. My freshman year I studied just kind of whenever or only when I had to. Now I take the same approach I take with working out I just schedule it into my day as something I am doing. My typical day is something like this...Go to class at from 9:30 to 2:20. Go home and eat lunch and relax until 3:30. Go to the rec and lift until 4:30/4:45. Shower and eat dinner. Study from 6:00 to 8:30. Then I have the rest of my night to do whatever I want, whether it's hang out, go party or go to bed. Of course, you'll have to tailor your schedule but you get the idea.\n* **Set goals for each time you study right when you start**. I used to always think \"I should probably study\" but that was it. That's not specific enough. Now, before I leave to study, I decide which class(es) I am going to study for and what material. Then, I only bring that stuff with me. I tend to choose what to study for week by week based on which class's material I understood the least from the week before.\n* **Give yourself breaks**. Figure out how long you can study for without needing a break and then only study that long. When you've hit that time, give yourself a fair-length break. For me, I usually can study for about 45-50 minutes at a time without getting antsy so I do that, and then give myself the rest of the hour to do what I want. Always set a timer on your computer or phone though. Don't just use the clock as a reference because that's way too easy to break from.\n* This one isn't as much directly related to studying as it will be your general productivity: **Get up everyday before 10:00 AM**. 10:00 in the real world is really late to wake up, but we're lucky college students. You should still get up at a reasonable time though. If you sleep in too late, you'll have to push everything back later into the night and that's when you'll start to want to not study. It will feel like studying is taking up your whole life because you will have to do that instead of partying or hanging out with friends. This will also allow you to have a decent bed time on nights where you don't party so getting up will be easier, and your days will feel longer and more productive.\n* **Make it a point to drink a ton of water after you get back from a party**. How will this help you study? Well it will make the day after the party easier in every way. Waking up at a decent time will be easier, you'll feel more rested, you won't feel like death and hate yourself. All of this will make your Saturdays (excluding football game days) and Sundays useful for studying too. If you aren't studying on the weekends then you are wasting your weekend. You likely don't have anything going on during the day that you can't spare 2-3 hours to study.\n* **Practice, practice, practice**. As an engineering student like I am, your curriculum is heavily based in math, science, and problem-solving. The best way to study those things are practice problems. If you can find some, practice using tests written by your professor or other professors at the university, since the questions on those will be most like what will be on your exam. If not, there are so many places online to find practice problems. The worst way to study for math and science is probably reading the book. Your textbook will likely only be useful for formulas and examples, but the text itself is going to be full of jargon and probably not be very helpful.If you need something explained and you haven't discovered it yet, Khan Academy is like the personal professor you've always wanted, and it's free.\n* **Go to office hours**. Find a way to get face-time with your professor outside of lecture, even if you don't have a question about the material yet, get into their office and get to know them, and make sure they know who you are. Some things that I've benefitted from by doing this already in only 2 years in college: had a grade bumped up from A- to A for no reason other than my professor liked me; was advised by the professor what types of questions the exam consisted of just because I frequented their office; Was referred to for a undergrad research position, and now I'll have multiple scientific papers with my name on the published before I graduate. Nothing but good can come from getting on your professor's good side. \n* **Get Involved**. It can be a club, a job, volunteering, whatever, it doesn't even have to be big, just something. Pick something you enjoy or try something new. Some people get involved in something because they care about that issue or activity or group of people. If you can find something like that, great! If not, get involved in something for the selfish reason of \"doing this will make me a more productive person and I'll do better in school because of it\". My involvement has been my research. Busy people are productive people. When you have a lot to do, you tend to organize it and schedule yourself. People who aren't involved and just go to class and go home trick themselves into thinking they have all this time and so they procrastinate, and it never works out well in the end, because by thinking they have so much time, they end up wasting all of it and getting themselves in a jam.\n* **Don't be afraid to miss something**. I know partying is fun. I love it too. But I just bailed on my house's biggest party of the year to study this past Friday because I knew I needed to study for my 4 finals on Monday and Tuesday. It sucks, but sometimes you have to do it. There will be plenty more parties to go to, but it's your grades that will help you far more in the future than making sure you made it to every single party.\n* **Don't be afraid to go really hard if you need to**. If you've been studying a little bit everyday and you have an exam coming up, definitely review. If you start and find that you don't remember as much as you think you should, don't think for even one second \"well, I guess I won't do as well as I thought\". That will turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy. People will tell you that pulling all-nighters doesn't work. And if you're trying to teach yourself an entire semester, or even an entire unit in one night, then they're right, you're screwed. But since you've been studying some each week, you should have at least some knowledge over everything that's been covered, an all-nighter might just do the trick to get you that grade you want on the exam. Let me emphasize though: don't do this often, this is a strategy of last resort. The final cramming you do will be pure memorization for the sake of the grade. It definitely works, but many times you will have to review the material again later to make sure you fully understood it. The highest grades I've gotten on exams were physics and chemistry finals last year and I did this for them because they were on the same day. I got the grades I wanted, and then reviewed some before I moved out. It's because of that last little review that I was able to retain all of the information. The cramming was only for the grade.\n\nHopefully this helps. These aren't by any means set in stone, it's just what has worked best for me starting this year, and mostly this semester.
