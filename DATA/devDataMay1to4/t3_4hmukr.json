This all stems from the misconception that lobsters are biologically immortal. This isn't really wrong, but people tend to take it to a conclusion that is.\nLobsters have an enzyme called telomerase, which rejuvenates the end caps of DNA and prevents it from degrading. Humans don't have this, and this degradation is one of the main contributors in our theories of aging.\nBecause lobsters have this enzyme they never reach what we consider a mature age or elderly, so they just keep growing as long as they eat. But as they grow they are required to eat more and may grow themselves out of a survivable range. Another major factor is that lobsters molt, this is not an easy task and can prove too much for an older or excessively large lobster.\n&gt; So while we grow old by degradation and lose our ability to recuperate lobsters grow old in the opposite fashion, by lack of degradation and inability to maintain oneself. It is not aging in the same fashion but it is most definitely still aging.&gt; \n\n\nEdit...

This all stems from the misconception that lobsters are biologically immortal. This isn&amp;#39;t really wrong, but people tend to take it to a conclusion that is.\nLobsters have an enzyme called telomerase, which rejuvenates the end caps of DNA and prevents it from degrading. Humans don&amp;#39;t have this, and this degradation is one of the main contributors in our theories of aging.\nBecause lobsters have this enzyme they never reach what we consider a mature age or elderly, so they just keep growing as long as they eat. But as they grow they are required to eat more and may grow themselves out of a survivable range.
