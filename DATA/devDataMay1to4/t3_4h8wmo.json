If you can, be flirty with him in front of his friends. If he isn't getting the hint, his friends probably will. ", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some types of flirtation - smiling, joking, etc. - are too ambiguous for many guys, and can easily be packed into the &amp;#39;she must just be friendly&amp;#39; department. Especially when many of us have interpreted what we thought to be flirtation as advances, only to find out that she really was just being friendly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The most obvious way to show interest is to just bloody say you&amp;#39;re interested. &amp;quot;I like you. Can I take you out sometime?&amp;quot;. Or maybe you can give him a bit of control by asking something like &amp;quot;Do you want to take me out for drinks sometime?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Short of that, most guys will start to get the point if you&amp;#39;re a bit touchy-feely. I don&amp;#39;t mean &amp;#39;grope-y&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;surprise bear-hug him from behind&amp;#39;, which can be a little off-putting if they aren&amp;#39;t already interested. But if you haven&amp;#39;t seen him for a few days, act excited to see him and maybe give him a hug. Try to slowly close the &amp;#39;personal space&amp;#39; barriers and see how he reacts. If he&amp;#39;s sitting on a bench, sit closer to him than you would to any other coworker. Maybe let your legs touch, and see if he moves his away. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, people talk. If you can, be flirty with him in front of his friends.
