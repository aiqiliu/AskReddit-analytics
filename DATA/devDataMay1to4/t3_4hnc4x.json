There is no convincing a person who thinks scientists are feeding lies.The problem isn&amp;#39;t that they don&amp;#39;t have lack of information, it&amp;#39;s that they lack critical thinking skills. They can&amp;#39;t differentiate fact from opinion. Even if you were to educate them on climate change, they won&amp;#39;t believe it. Until it directly happens to them. It&amp;#39;s easy to live smack in the middle of the United States and say &amp;quot;oceans aren&amp;#39;t rising because I don&amp;#39;t live by an ocean.&amp;quot; So pretty much, my argument is that climate change deniers in Western world can&amp;#39;t differentiate fact and opinion, not lack of climate change knowledge. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2rlgg2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462341188.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462312388.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hnc4x", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2rfxva", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "IAmTheNight2014", "parent_id": "t1_d2r1220", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "It's already too late.
