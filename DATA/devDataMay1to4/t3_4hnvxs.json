I am incredibly clumsy to say the least...\n\nAll right, so when I was about 14-15, I was in a PE lesson, and we were hula-hooping. It's a surprisingly good workout. The teacher told us to split into groups and create a routine. I came up with the genius idea of jumping through a hoop like a dog would. So, my classmate held up the hoop and I ran and jumped through it.\n\nThe first time went fine! It was a big hoop, and I was able to get through. On my second jump, I went faster. I caught my foot on the bottom of the hoop, and flew two metres through the air, landing with an almighty crash on the floor.\n\nI had a huge bruise on my leg for weeks. This thing was apple-sized, and hurt like fuck. I couldn't move for a good minute and had to sit out the rest of the lesson. I don't know what I was thinking, truth be told - I am clumsy as fuck. I cut my eyelid open with my fingernail while brushing hair out of my eye. There was no way this wasn't going to end badly.\n\nThe worst part is that everyone turned to see what had happened, saw it was me, and went back to what they were doing. My schoolmates were beyond used to this. Except the Chinese student who'd been in the UK for a couple of months. She was worried.

I am incredibly clumsy to say the least...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All right, so when I was about 14-15, I was in a PE lesson, and we were hula-hooping. It&amp;#39;s a surprisingly good workout. The teacher told us to split into groups and create a routine. I came up with the genius idea of jumping through a hoop like a dog would. So, my classmate held up the hoop and I ran and jumped through it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first time went fine! It was a big hoop, and I was able to get through. On my second jump, I went faster. I caught my foot on the bottom of the hoop, and flew two metres through the air, landing with an almighty crash on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had a huge bruise on my leg for weeks. This thing was apple-sized, and hurt like fuck. I couldn&amp;#39;t move for a good minute and had to sit out the rest of the lesson. I don&amp;#39;t know what I was thinking, truth be told - I am clumsy as fuck. I cut my eyelid open with my fingernail while brushing hair out of my eye.

I was really high one time and pondering life&amp;#39;s mysteries while waiting for my toast to be ready. I then wondered what if I&amp;#39;m actually psychic and just didn&amp;#39;t know it yet. I decided to test my theory by predicting the exact moment the toast would pop up and then catching it. I then knew this was my moment. I moved my hand above the toaster to catch the toast as I figured it was just about to pop. As I did that it actually popped up and startled me, causing my hand to jerk up and hit the cupboard above the toaster. Hurt my hand and I had to laugh at my self because of how stupid I was until I realised maybe I was right. \nTL;DR With great toast comes great responsibilities. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2ransn", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462327253.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462298453.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hnvxs", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hnvxs", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 1, "parent_id": "t1_d2rcwul", "children": ["d2sdltl"], "name": "t1_d2sdltl", "id": "d2sdltl"}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2rcwul", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "throwCharley", "parent_id": "t1_d2r62ef", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "palm muscle?", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;palm muscle?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2rcwul", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462330157.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462301357.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2r62ef", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "A_Parked_Car", "parent_id": "t3_4hnvxs", "score": 5, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Just about any instance of me pulling a muscle or getting a cramp while I'm diddling my doodle.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just about any instance of me pulling a muscle or getting a cramp while I&amp;#39;m diddling my doodle.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2r62ef", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462321288.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462292488.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hnvxs", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2rbv1g", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Radlyfe", "parent_id": "t3_4hnvxs", "score": 6, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I stuck both legs through the same pant hole and ended up falling over and bruising my right butt cheek while butt naked.
