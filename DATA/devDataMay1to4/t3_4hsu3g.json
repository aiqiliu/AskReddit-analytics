In my opinion it is in almost every way inferior in terms of quality of film, but it&amp;#39;s still just as enjoyable. Of course, when I was a little kid Return of the Jedi was my favorite because what little kid doesn&amp;#39;t like cute teddy bears and happy endings, and doesn&amp;#39;t give a fuck about if a movie is actually good or not?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I think I&amp;#39;m in the same place with the Force Awakens. It&amp;#39;s not anything absolutely mind blowing and arguably nothing terribly original, but it was a ton of fun to watch and that was what mattered to me when I went into the theatre last December.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2sauj9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462391219.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462362419.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 19}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2s2jfa", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Jux_", "parent_id": "t1_d2s1cmd", "score": 31, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "It was my favorite as a child, and the only original trilogy film made while I was alive.

Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m some kind of heathen. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To me, most of the CGI served to make the universe feel larger and more advanced (like everything in Mos Eisley) patch continuity issues (like the new Palpatine hologram in Empire) or just fix dodgy 70s/80s effects. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only one that really bugged me was the new dance number in Jabba\u2019s palace, as it felt really out of place, but even that wasn\u2019t a dealbreaker for me. I also love the redone ROTJ ending, with the music, flyovers of other worlds, and even the young Anakin ghost. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, I never really cared about the edit to the Han/Greedo scene, as I didn\u2019t really consider it some kind of super-important character beat, the way people that micro-analyze it seem to. No matter what cut of the scene\u2019s being viewed, he was threatened at gunpoint, kills his attacker, and coolly flips the bartender a coin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyone else feel that way?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2sie79", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462404186.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462375386.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 13}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hsu3g", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hsu3g", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hsu3g", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2sahtn", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SnowHesher", "parent_id": "t1_d2s9mc5", "score": 7, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "The Gungans were actually pretty badass in the *Clone Wars* animated series.
