I think of things that are existing and how they exist in the present, like my hands and how they feel, or the light around me, and other things like that :)\n\nSee, anxiety is interesting because usually the mind is thinking of something *other* than the present. People often think of past mistakes or future deadlines or events they believe to be inevitable. Remember this, if nothing else: The past *was* real, the future *might* become real, but the present *is* real.

The past shapes us, the future invites us to shape it. \n\nSecond, I think of people who have smiled at me, been kind, and things like that. This is to prevent a relapse into the panic state, because it usually makes me smile and everyone knows it is hard to be sad and smile at the same time. \n\nThird, I deep breathe and try to embody love for myself and everyone. This doesn't work for everyone, but with practice, you can start really turning your mindset around. \n\nPanic attacks vary for everyone, but they suck. If you've never had one, just imagine a terrifying and overwhelming feeling that you're a rat caught in the maw of some predator (life) and the jaws are getting tighter no matter what you think you can do.\n\nIt is *usually* a mindset change that suddenly grips a person's mind and can literally consume them. The only way I have found to counter anxiety is to grab it back and face it with love for yourself and the present moment. \n\n*TL;DR* focus on the present to quickly change your perspective.

Remember this, if nothing else: The past &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; real, the future &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; become real, but the present &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; real. Focus on what is real, and you will realize your true self and learn who you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; because that is your being. The past shapes us, the future invites us to shape it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second, I think of people who have smiled at me, been kind, and things like that. This is to prevent a relapse into the panic state, because it usually makes me smile and everyone knows it is hard to be sad and smile at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Third, I deep breathe and try to embody love for myself and everyone. This doesn&amp;#39;t work for everyone, but with practice, you can start really turning your mindset around. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Panic attacks vary for everyone, but they suck. If you&amp;#39;ve never had one, just imagine a terrifying and overwhelming feeling that you&amp;#39;re a rat caught in the maw of some predator (life) and the jaws are getting tighter no matter what you think you can do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is &lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt; a mindset change that suddenly grips a person&amp;#39;s mind and can literally consume them. The only way I have found to counter anxiety is to grab it back and face it with love for yourself and the present moment. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TL;DR&lt;/em&gt; focus on the present to quickly change your perspective. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2osv7z", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462163834.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462135034.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 18}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hb6r3", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2ot7f7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "hungarianstupidity", "parent_id": "t3_4hb6r3", "score": 8, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I live in a small town where I used to go to school for 8 years.

Usually with my daughter. I have post partum panic disorder though so I&amp;#39;m terrified something will happen to her and I won&amp;#39;t be able to get health. I have the normal death fears too (you know, what if I have a heart attack and die and no one is here to take care of her type thing). My strangest one is I freak out at even the mention of suicide. For some reason I have this panic loop at the thought that what if one day I kill myself even though I have no plans to, don&amp;#39;t want to, and in reality would never consider it an option.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2oxjv5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462171464.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462142664.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hb6r3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 1, "parent_id": "t1_d2oyhv1", "id": "d2p79uq", "name": "t1_d2p79uq", "children": ["d2p79uq"]}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2oyhv1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "sadlyecstatic", "parent_id": "t3_4hb6r3", "score": 6, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Heat triggers me badly, and I've never really understood *it.", "edited": 1462153017.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heat triggers me badly, and I&amp;#39;ve never really understood *it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2oyhv1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462173095.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462144295.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hb6r3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hb6r3", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2p7h7g", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Go_J", "parent_id": "t1_d2p1hr1", "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I know what you mean.
