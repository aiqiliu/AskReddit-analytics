Whether their horrible behavior is directed towards you or something else, it can get suffocating and is probably the last thing you need. *These people do not and will not matter to you in a few years time, no matter how close you are to them now.* If they're jeopardizing your ability to heal, dump 'em. It's not you, it's them. It really is. Chances are, if you're anything like me, you'll witness karma kick their butts in a few years and/or they'll come apologizing for being crappy to you. \nFind people that can make you laugh, make you forget, or even introduce you to something new. All of my current friends are absolutely nothing like the friends I had 5 years ago, and I am so thankful for them.\n\n* Understand that loving yourself is not being selfish.

If it isn't okay to other people, please refer to my first bullet point and get them out of your life)\n\n* Challenge yourself every day.\nSounds kind of dumb, but completing small goals or challenges can make you feel accomplished. Whether it's \"I'm gonna go for a walk for an hour today\" or \"I'm gonna ask that girl in my class about that book she's always gabbing about\" making yourself do something random or out of the ordinary can make you uncomfortable, but help you gain comfort in yourself and embrace the person you are. It's all about self-love, which doesn't happen overnight.\n\n* Don't see a psychiatrist first. \n**PLEASE. DO NOT.** Go to a therapist, and try to get some coping mechanisms. It takes time, yes, but it may just prove to be more effective. Everyone sees a psychiatrist as the superior, the \"quick fix\" and they are not. Yes, you can get meds. No, they may not help. See a Psychologist first and allow them to know you and attempt to work with them. If that doesn't seem to be doing much to help, allow a release of information to get a psychiatrist to work hand-in-hand with your therapist.\n\n(Personally, it took me YEARS of trying out meds to ever feel sane.
