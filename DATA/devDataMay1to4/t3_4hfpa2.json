I remember crying like crazy and the man who was sitting beside told me to shut up or he would beat me. \nA few hours later they pull into a gas station to get gas. The driver was going to pay and I think the other guy went to take a piss. I literally opened the door and ran across the street and hid in a convenice store. I told the guy behind the counter that they are not my parents. They just drove off though. Police was called and they tookbme to the station and asked me what they looked like. After that my mom came and picked me up and took me home. I remember her hugging me and saying sorry alot.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2pqet4", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462233054.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462204254.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 173}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hfpa2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hfpa2", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2pow5m", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Dark_Vengence", "parent_id": "t1_d2pl62j", "score": 164, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "At least you are aright.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least you are aright.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2pow5m", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462230009.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462201209.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 164}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hfpa2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hfpa2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 1, "parent_id": "t1_d2pvacf", "id": "d2qpkys", "name": "t1_d2qpkys", "children": ["d2qpkys"]}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2pvacf", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "READMEtxt_", "parent_id": "t1_d2psjcw", "score": 86, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "They probably already had enough to lock him away already, and maybe wiped the pc or checked it.

I reached into my right pocket and used my fingernails to open the knife. I acted calm. I noticed the handle to open the van door was right next to me.

I said to him YOU PASSED MY ROAD. He smacked me and said to shut up or he would kill me. what he did not know was.. im a boy scout, and in my day we always... ALWAYS had our pocket knives on us. even in school. we just carried them everywhere. I knew that shortly down the road there was a stop sign, and I knew I was in trouble, and NOW I can hear my mothers voice in my head... never get into a vehical with a stranger... I reached into my right pocket and used my fingernails to open the knife. I acted calm. I noticed the handle to open the van door was right next to me. I saw the stop sign coming up and I knew I had to act fast. so I slowly pulled the knife from my pocket and lowered it to my right side (the older seat belts bolted to the side of the seat. so I put my hand down and slowly started cutting the belt. I manged to do it. just as he pulled up the the stop sign. Luckilling in these days it was not the retractable kind of seat belt either.  so I cut the belt, open the door and ran like hell in the oppisite direction. I knew the area really well so I went through a yard that I knew led back to a known set of woods to me.  I did manage however to also remember the licesnse plate number. TRG 993  once glance... they caught the guy with my description of the vehical and tag number.  needless to say, for now on unless that stranger has candy I dont care I aint getting in!  but thankfully having a pocket knife becasue I Was a scout saved my life!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2pwzwv", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462241811.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462213011.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 87}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hfpa2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 15, "parent_id": "t1_d2qdk68", "id": "d2qqjc4", "name": "t1_d2qqjc4", "children": ["d2qqjc4", "d2qijpn", "d2qhr1r", "d2qolbk", "d2qrxm9", "d2qfd95"]}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2qdk68", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "momsdayprepper", "parent_id": "t3_4hfpa2", "score": 41, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "This is kinda crazy for me, but I'll bite.

I walk to the bus stop and here he comes raging and grabs me by the arm and drags me two blocks by the arm and by the hair. I&amp;#39;m freaking out the whole way. He takes me upstairs into his house and I am in hysterics. I&amp;#39;m scared he might hurt the baby. Next thing I know he had a knife pointed at me and he tells me &amp;quot;I rather kill myself then either one of you.&amp;quot; Great, it&amp;#39;s gonna be a murder suicide. I somehow take the knife and throw it behind the couch and run to the bathroom call a taxi and tell him to come to the door and ask for me and that of I don&amp;#39;t come out to call the cops. Then he came and I left&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2ps06k", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462235407.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462206607.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 45}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hfpa2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 8, "parent_id": "t1_d2pofgp", "id": "d2qajdk", "name": "t1_d2qajdk", "children": ["d2qajdk", "d2qd0m9", "d2qn5uj", "d2qj0ad"]}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2pofgp", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "WHYUNOLETMEMAKETHROW", "parent_id": "t3_4hfpa2", "score": 114, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "made a throwaway because main account has personal info in it that people can figure out who I am. \n\nIts scary/funny/weird how the mind suppresses trauma especially when it happens young.

Basically it eventually became a power play, very manipulative and evil. Two incidences that really stood out to me:\n\n1. I pissed Alex off for some stupid reason, I think it was because I didn't have time to see him because I was busy with school work. Johnny showed up at my house out of the blue and told me I needed to come apologize to Alex. I was already pretty terrified of them at the time, so I came with. When we got to his house, Alex told me to come lay on the bed with him, where he had been waiting. He undressed me and had sex with me while I laid there, motionless, and crying.\n\n2. Alex and I were riding in the back of Johnny's pick up truck, as always. I don't remember where I thought we were going. Eventually I noticed we had been driving for a long time, were clearly out in the sticks, and I had no idea where we were. Alex told me not to worry about it. We pulled up to a small, lone bank. It was the middle of the night so it was closed and there was no one around. Alex pulled up a bank account to show me. I think it was around $100,000 that he had in there. Keep our ages in mind. He told me he had multiple other bank accounts with similar amounts of money. He implied that he got most of it from prostituting girls and that if I \"misbehaved,\" I would be one of them.\n\nOnto the night that he kidnapped me...\n\nI had been hanging out with Alex and Johnny all day. I told him multiple times over the course of a few days that I was planning on hanging out with my best friend, who we'll call Bryan, that night. When the evening rolled around, Alex threw a fit. I put my foot down because I was sick of his shit. Alex ended up slipping out of the house at some point, I guess when Johnny and I were talking because we didn't notice. When we realized he was gone, we locked up the house and Johnny and I went to Bryan's house. He lived only a few miles away, so we could come back if necessary. After a few hours, I began to worry because Alex was high on Xanax and already fucking crazy to begin with, and I lived in a very nice house in a very nice neighborhood. I lived with my dad, who was out of town but coming home the next morning. Anyways, Johnny and I go back to my house to look for Alex. When we get there, Alex calls us to come upstairs to my room. He got back in the house by smashing a window on our back porch and climbing in. When we got upstairs, Alex started to scream at me and tell me how horrible and uncaring I was. I just sat on the floor and started bawling, terrified, unsure of what to do. Johnny told him to knock it off because he was scaring me. Alex proceeded to start punching Johnny in the face, so Johnny went outside as to not engage. Alex tried to get me to have sex with him, but I was so paralyzed with fear, I couldn't even attempt to respond. I think at this point he got bored with me, so he went outside to have a cigarette. I eventually followed him and told him that he needs to leave. He punched me in the face. I ran inside and tried to call 911, but Alex grabbed my phone from me and smashed it to absolute shit. The next bit is kind of a blur because it was pure chaos, but at one point, Alex tried to stab me in the stomach with a large knife he got from our kitchen. I jumped back and he missed. He tackled me onto the floor and held the knife to my throat and tried to start undressing me. I had grabbed a self defense weapon that I got after taking a self defense class (it was something like a Knuckle Kitty, but not exactly) and hit him in the temple with it, hard. He was slightly stunned and I used a technique I learned in that class to bump him off of me. I got up but was honestly too in shock to know what to do next, although I should have bolted outside screaming to get my neighbor's attention. Alex climbed up on the roof and told me that he was going to kill himself if I didn't tell him that I love him and that I would go back to his house with him. This went on for about an hour because I refused to agree to those things. But Alex won, as he always does, because he threatened to tell the cops about a friend of mine who was selling weed to survive (he lived in an extreme abuse/neglect situation, but that's another story). So I climbed in the back of the pick up truck and began to cry. I thought for sure this was how my life ended. While Johnny drove, Alex held me and told me how much he loves me, that he would never let me leave because he wanted me to be his forever, but that I also needed to be punished for being so bad tonight. Johnny stopped at the gas station a block away from Alex's house for gas and some smokes. Alex went inside while Johnny was \"watching me.\" Johnny told me that if I ran inside and locked myself in the bathroom, he would call Bryan to come get me. That this had gotten out of hand. So I did exactly that. About half an hour later, Bryan knocked on the door and I went and spent the night with him.\n\nWhen Alex heard what happened, he ran the block to his house, got on his dirt bike, and rode it down the highway and into a guard rail. He survived but was in the hospital for weeks. I got a lot of shit for not visiting him, even from people that knew what happened. I wish he had died that night.\n\nHe continued to harass me for awhile, but I had totally snapped and would appear completely batshit insane whenever he called me or showed up at my house out of the blue. I guess he lost interest after awhile since I had turned into a different person because he stopped contacting me, except for a random message here and there every few months. Thankfully I moved to a different state a few months after \"the big incident.\"\n\nTL;DR: was in abusive relationship, he broke into my house, blackmailed me into coming home with him, his friend helped me escape, my ex tried unsuccessfully to kill himself.\n\nI'm open to answering most questions if you guys have any. I've mostly put this behind me except for the fact that I'm permanently more anxious than normal, always very jumpy, frequent nightmares, etc.. I think it's good to talk about it though. I haven't in a long time because it's pretty heavy shit to lay on people I know in real life.

He implied that he got most of it from prostituting girls and that if I &amp;quot;misbehaved,&amp;quot; I would be one of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Onto the night that he kidnapped me...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had been hanging out with Alex and Johnny all day. I told him multiple times over the course of a few days that I was planning on hanging out with my best friend, who we&amp;#39;ll call Bryan, that night. When the evening rolled around, Alex threw a fit. I put my foot down because I was sick of his shit. Alex ended up slipping out of the house at some point, I guess when Johnny and I were talking because we didn&amp;#39;t notice. When we realized he was gone, we locked up the house and Johnny and I went to Bryan&amp;#39;s house. He lived only a few miles away, so we could come back if necessary. After a few hours, I began to worry because Alex was high on Xanax and already fucking crazy to begin with, and I lived in a very nice house in a very nice neighborhood. I lived with my dad, who was out of town but coming home the next morning. Anyways, Johnny and I go back to my house to look for Alex. When we get there, Alex calls us to come upstairs to my room. He got back in the house by smashing a window on our back porch and climbing in. When we got upstairs, Alex started to scream at me and tell me how horrible and uncaring I was. I just sat on the floor and started bawling, terrified, unsure of what to do. Johnny told him to knock it off because he was scaring me. Alex proceeded to start punching Johnny in the face, so Johnny went outside as to not engage. Alex tried to get me to have sex with him, but I was so paralyzed with fear, I couldn&amp;#39;t even attempt to respond. I think at this point he got bored with me, so he went outside to have a cigarette. I eventually followed him and told him that he needs to leave. He punched me in the face. I ran inside and tried to call 911, but Alex grabbed my phone from me and smashed it to absolute shit. The next bit is kind of a blur because it was pure chaos, but at one point, Alex tried to stab me in the stomach with a large knife he got from our kitchen. I jumped back and he missed. He tackled me onto the floor and held the knife to my throat and tried to start undressing me. I had grabbed a self defense weapon that I got after taking a self defense class (it was something like a Knuckle Kitty, but not exactly) and hit him in the temple with it, hard. He was slightly stunned and I used a technique I learned in that class to bump him off of me. I got up but was honestly too in shock to know what to do next, although I should have bolted outside screaming to get my neighbor&amp;#39;s attention. Alex climbed up on the roof and told me that he was going to kill himself if I didn&amp;#39;t tell him that I love him and that I would go back to his house with him. This went on for about an hour because I refused to agree to those things. But Alex won, as he always does, because he threatened to tell the cops about a friend of mine who was selling weed to survive (he lived in an extreme abuse/neglect situation, but that&amp;#39;s another story). So I climbed in the back of the pick up truck and began to cry. I thought for sure this was how my life ended. While Johnny drove, Alex held me and told me how much he loves me, that he would never let me leave because he wanted me to be his forever, but that I also needed to be punished for being so bad tonight. Johnny stopped at the gas station a block away from Alex&amp;#39;s house for gas and some smokes. Alex went inside while Johnny was &amp;quot;watching me.&amp;quot; Johnny told me that if I ran inside and locked myself in the bathroom, he would call Bryan to come get me. That this had gotten out of hand. So I did exactly that. About half an hour later, Bryan knocked on the door and I went and spent the night with him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When Alex heard what happened, he ran the block to his house, got on his dirt bike, and rode it down the highway and into a guard rail. He survived but was in the hospital for weeks. I got a lot of shit for not visiting him, even from people that knew what happened. I wish he had died that night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He continued to harass me for awhile, but I had totally snapped and would appear completely batshit insane whenever he called me or showed up at my house out of the blue. I guess he lost interest after awhile since I had turned into a different person because he stopped contacting me, except for a random message here and there every few months. Thankfully I moved to a different state a few months after &amp;quot;the big incident.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: was in abusive relationship, he broke into my house, blackmailed me into coming home with him, his friend helped me escape, my ex tried unsuccessfully to kill himself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m open to answering most questions if you guys have any. I&amp;#39;ve mostly put this behind me except for the fact that I&amp;#39;m permanently more anxious than normal, always very jumpy, frequent nightmares, etc.. I think it&amp;#39;s good to talk about it though. I haven&amp;#39;t in a long time because it&amp;#39;s pretty heavy shit to lay on people I know in real life.

So what I didn't know at the time was that my parents were 'functioning drug users'. So the law finds out about my mum loses custody. But my dad though that wasn't right even though he was never supportive (left, took money, abusive).\n\n Sometime after dropping me home after baby sitting me he asks if I would like to come and stay with him.
