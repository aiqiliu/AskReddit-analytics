It means people pick those things up.  However, when leaving business cards at diners in certain areas of town, I should expect some issues.\n\nThis call came through on a dreary December day as I was sipping coffee and watching the snow fall.  The caller ID read that it was the local hospital, and as I picked up I spoke to a rather frantic young man who informed me he was being held against his will and he needed an attorney to help him.  When I asked where he was, he simply said \"the 5th floor.\"  While this may sound innocuous, every hospital has a \"5th Floor,\" where Napoleon roams the halls freely and the residents speak to their imaginary friends who may, or may not, have been an influencing factor in why they decided that clothing was a way for the government to track them and therefore the only solution was to create Poop Pants to throw off the monitoring ability of the CIA.\n\nLong story short on this portion, within an hour of the call a friend had dropped off my fee, and I was en route to the Fifth Floor to meet with my new client.  I assumed it would be an involuntary committal defense, and after speaking with my client I gauged that, while the man was most definitely in need of mental care, he was not a danger to himself or others and was unlikely to be one.  He had, in my opinion, been forced to agree to being committed by his probation officer, and frankly I wasn't going to let that stand.  I got the name of some contacts from his treatment plan who were willing to vouch that he had, until recently, been compliant with his medications, and contacted his social worker who was able to confirm that, yes, since he had ceased taking the medication due to an inability to afford the medications, the county would assist him with it.  A slam dunk, I would simply swing my big lawyer dick around the mental ward and get him released, then appear in the Court to defend against the involuntary committal.\n\nWithin 24 hours of being committed, my client was back at home.  A hearing was set a couple weeks in the future, and I did daily checks to be certain he was compliant with his medication leading up to the hearing...until the one day I didn't.\n\nA call from the local police was my tip off.  An older officer, one I was familiar with, called to advise they had responded to a disturbance at my client's home.  He apparently had been screaming in an empty room loud enough that the neighbors were concerned and called the police.  The police officer, a friendly sort, gauged the situation and decided my client wasn't a threat, but asked what the situation was.\n\n\"The ghost,\" my client had responded, \"The ghost won't get out and it won't leave me alone.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the officer, \"I can tell it to leave.\"\n\nSo he did.  He told the ghost to leave.  And then, apparently for shits and giggles, told him that it was a \"civil matter\" if the ghost refused to leave, and therefore an attorney would need to be contacted.  At which point my client dropped my name....which resulted in the cop giving me a heads up.\n\nSo, I call my client...who is inconsolable at the concept of sharing his home with the ghost.  Keep in mind, I've been to this guy's house.  This is the first I've heard of a ghost.  But there is a competency hearing on the horizon, and this will not play well in front of the judge.\n\n\"The cop said it's a civil matter,\" my client repeated about the 18th time after I told him I was not, in fact, a priest, but was a lawyer and didn't know how to perform an exorcism.\n\n\"What do you want me to do,\" I snapped a bit, \"Evict it?\"\n\nThere are moments in time when you should keep your mouth shut.  This is one of them, because the immediate response was \"CAN YOU?  THAT'D BE GREAT!\"\n\nWell shit.\n\nSo, long story short, I ended up driving out there with a \"Mock Up\" Notice to Quit addressed to \"Any spirits in possession of the property located at [1313 Mockingbird Lane] without any authority under color of law\" advising them that their possession was \"unlawful in nature\" and ordering them to \"quit and surrender the premises, or any portion thereof, within fifteen (15) days of the date of this notice.\"  \n\nAs I was obviously unable to obtain personal service via hand delivery, I had my client direct me to the portion of the premises the Ghost occupied, an empty spare bedroom, and made service by posting the Notice to the door of the room.  I then announced that the ghost \"HAD BEEN SERVED A VALID NOTICE TO QUIT AND SURRENDER POSSESSION\" and went home.\n\nA week later, as we're preparing to enter the Court for my client's competency hearing, I ask about the status.\n\n\"Oh Mr. Creepy, it worked great!\" my client announced.  \"He moved out the same night and *took all his stuff with him*.\"\n\nThe ghost apparently had \"stuff.\"\n\nAnyhow, I smiled and patted my client on the shoulder as I offered some sage advice.\n\n\"Well, good,\" I said, \"now, let's not mention this in front of the judge.  He might have a problem with the service and order us to let the ghost back in if he finds out about it.\"\n\nMy client nodded enthusiastically.  I kept him out of the mental hospital that day, and take some comfort knowing somewhere today this crazy bastard is still telling people about his great lawyer who got rid of his ethereal roommate for free.\n\nEDIT:  Hey!  It's been awesome checking in and reading your comments today.  Made a slow day go quick for me.  However, I'm hearing the happy hour bell a-ringing, so I'm skedaddling.

If you really are itching to spend that money cause you like this, go ahead and send it to a place like [Horizon House](http://www.hhinc.org/Index.asp?ArticleID=276) which can help people like my client in the above post, okay?

When I asked where he was, he simply said &amp;quot;the 5th floor.&amp;quot;  While this may sound innocuous, every hospital has a &amp;quot;5th Floor,&amp;quot; where Napoleon roams the halls freely and the residents speak to their imaginary friends who may, or may not, have been an influencing factor in why they decided that clothing was a way for the government to track them and therefore the only solution was to create Poop Pants to throw off the monitoring ability of the CIA.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Long story short on this portion, within an hour of the call a friend had dropped off my fee, and I was en route to the Fifth Floor to meet with my new client.  I assumed it would be an involuntary committal defense, and after speaking with my client I gauged that, while the man was most definitely in need of mental care, he was not a danger to himself or others and was unlikely to be one.  He had, in my opinion, been forced to agree to being committed by his probation officer, and frankly I wasn&amp;#39;t going to let that stand.  I got the name of some contacts from his treatment plan who were willing to vouch that he had, until recently, been compliant with his medications, and contacted his social worker who was able to confirm that, yes, since he had ceased taking the medication due to an inability to afford the medications, the county would assist him with it.  A slam dunk, I would simply swing my big lawyer dick around the mental ward and get him released, then appear in the Court to defend against the involuntary committal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Within 24 hours of being committed, my client was back at home.  A hearing was set a couple weeks in the future, and I did daily checks to be certain he was compliant with his medication leading up to the hearing...until the one day I didn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A call from the local police was my tip off.  An older officer, one I was familiar with, called to advise they had responded to a disturbance at my client&amp;#39;s home.  He apparently had been screaming in an empty room loud enough that the neighbors were concerned and called the police.  The police officer, a friendly sort, gauged the situation and decided my client wasn&amp;#39;t a threat, but asked what the situation was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The ghost,&amp;quot; my client had responded, &amp;quot;The ghost won&amp;#39;t get out and it won&amp;#39;t leave me alone.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well,&amp;quot; said the officer, &amp;quot;I can tell it to leave.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So he did.  He told the ghost to leave.  And then, apparently for shits and giggles, told him that it was a &amp;quot;civil matter&amp;quot; if the ghost refused to leave, and therefore an attorney would need to be contacted.  At which point my client dropped my name....which resulted in the cop giving me a heads up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, I call my client...who is inconsolable at the concept of sharing his home with the ghost.  Keep in mind, I&amp;#39;ve been to this guy&amp;#39;s house.  This is the first I&amp;#39;ve heard of a ghost.  But there is a competency hearing on the horizon, and this will not play well in front of the judge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The cop said it&amp;#39;s a civil matter,&amp;quot; my client repeated about the 18th time after I told him I was not, in fact, a priest, but was a lawyer and didn&amp;#39;t know how to perform an exorcism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What do you want me to do,&amp;quot; I snapped a bit, &amp;quot;Evict it?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are moments in time when you should keep your mouth shut.  This is one of them, because the immediate response was &amp;quot;CAN YOU?  THAT&amp;#39;D BE GREAT!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well shit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, long story short, I ended up driving out there with a &amp;quot;Mock Up&amp;quot; Notice to Quit addressed to &amp;quot;Any spirits in possession of the property located at [1313 Mockingbird Lane] without any authority under color of law&amp;quot; advising them that their possession was &amp;quot;unlawful in nature&amp;quot; and ordering them to &amp;quot;quit and surrender the premises, or any portion thereof, within fifteen (15) days of the date of this notice.&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I was obviously unable to obtain personal service via hand delivery, I had my client direct me to the portion of the premises the Ghost occupied, an empty spare bedroom, and made service by posting the Notice to the door of the room.  I then announced that the ghost &amp;quot;HAD BEEN SERVED A VALID NOTICE TO QUIT AND SURRENDER POSSESSION&amp;quot; and went home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A week later, as we&amp;#39;re preparing to enter the Court for my client&amp;#39;s competency hearing, I ask about the status.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh Mr. Creepy, it worked great!&amp;quot; my client announced.  &amp;quot;He moved out the same night and &lt;em&gt;took all his stuff with him&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The ghost apparently had &amp;quot;stuff.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, I smiled and patted my client on the shoulder as I offered some sage advice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well, good,&amp;quot; I said, &amp;quot;now, let&amp;#39;s not mention this in front of the judge.  He might have a problem with the service and order us to let the ghost back in if he finds out about it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My client nodded enthusiastically.  I kept him out of the mental hospital that day, and take some comfort knowing somewhere today this crazy bastard is still telling people about his great lawyer who got rid of his ethereal roommate for free.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT:  Hey!  It&amp;#39;s been awesome checking in and reading your comments today.  Made a slow day go quick for me.  However, I&amp;#39;m hearing the happy hour bell a-ringing, so I&amp;#39;m skedaddling.  Glad you folks enjoyed this, and be nice to the lawyers in your life.  We&amp;#39;re really nice people behind the asshole-flavored-coating.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;LAST EDIT:  Also, no more gold, please.  If you really are itching to spend that money cause you like this, go ahead and send it to a place like &lt;a href=\"http://www.hhinc.org/Index.asp?ArticleID=276\"&gt;Horizon House&lt;/a&gt; which can help people like my client in the above post, okay?

I took down their site. I sent them a letter about how families should treat one another with a passworded zip of all their files. The password was at the bottom of the letter so they had to read it to receive it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Got sued for six figures. They were pulling in at most $300 a month. They said that I did irreputable damage to their site and that they couldn&amp;#39;t get the site online because it was impossible. In court, they brought the whole database printed out. When they showed it to me on the stand, I laughed because I told the judge, that&amp;#39;s all the information that they said they couldn&amp;#39;t receive or open. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All the counts were in my favor. Best part was prior to our court session, my lawyer suggested highly that we settle out of court. I offered $10,000. They didnt&amp;#39; take it.

Every day was \"outrageous\" and goes something like this - But I have a restraining order on my first ever \"client\":\n\nThe very first person I ever spoke to in a legal capacity was a woman who wanted to sue her contractor for $250,000 for an unfinished job and emotional distress. First, being upset at an incomplete job isn't emotional distress. Second, The contract was only for about $100,000 and upon further questioning I learned that this contractor had actually completed all terms of the contract. This woman eventually admitted she was suing him because he was \"Rude and always late.\"\n\nI informed her that we would not take this case. Additionally I warned her that a failure to pay the contract would most likely result in the contractor suing her. She found this idea ludicrous and began to yell at me in my office - first person on my first day - about how she had a right as an American that I act as her lawyer. So I handle that, we are not helping her in this case. \n\nTwo days later, I get a call from the Contractor's attorney stating that this woman has cited me as her attorney and threatened a hailstorm of suits upon the contractor from me. It took all of 5 minutes for the other Attorney to realize what was going on. Heck, they even made sure to remind me of the steps I should take to protect myself from any related suits this lady might bring upon me. Actually... I still talk to this attorney, so silver lining on the first day I suppose. \n\nAbout a month or two passes (foggy on timeframe). Woman comes in again, furious because the contractor sued her and was able to get a lien on the property. She said this was my fault because I didn't help her. I manage to talk her down. She then immediately gets fired up again because \"they are trying to scam her into giving them all her documents.\" Turns out, trial on the matter was coming up in about a week, and they had requested photographs of allegedly unfinished work, damages, etc... as well as the original contract and payment receipts. Basically - all stuff very very typical and reasonable to request and that she is *obligated* to provide. She (and nearly every client I worked with in this capacity) thought that evidence was supposed to be a \"surprise\" at trial and that sharing this information would hurt her case. NO shit it would hurt her case because she is a liar. \n\nAnyways, again. Not her lawyer. Actually make her sign a paper signifying she understands this. She leaves. Months pass, I'm no longer at Legal Aid. Lady finds me at my school. I get a call from the fucking dean asking me to swing by. Says he just met with a disgruntled client of mine who says I cost her her home, marriage, and children (apparently things went downhill fast). She claimed she would do everything in her power to make sure I never did anything again. Anyyyways, dean is a nice guy and helped me with my restraining order paperwork. \n\n*TL:DR* - First \"client\" ever was some crazy lady lying psycho who keept thinking I'm her lawyer. She Loses everything, stalks &amp; threatens me, gets restraining order filed against her. \n\n\nEither that or the time somebody wanted me to sue their ex's infant for lost sleep.

This woman eventually admitted she was suing him because he was &amp;quot;Rude and always late.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I informed her that we would not take this case. Additionally I warned her that a failure to pay the contract would most likely result in the contractor suing her. She found this idea ludicrous and began to yell at me in my office - first person on my first day - about how she had a right as an American that I act as her lawyer. So I handle that, we are not helping her in this case. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two days later, I get a call from the Contractor&amp;#39;s attorney stating that this woman has cited me as her attorney and threatened a hailstorm of suits upon the contractor from me. It took all of 5 minutes for the other Attorney to realize what was going on. Heck, they even made sure to remind me of the steps I should take to protect myself from any related suits this lady might bring upon me. Actually... I still talk to this attorney, so silver lining on the first day I suppose. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About a month or two passes (foggy on timeframe). Woman comes in again, furious because the contractor sued her and was able to get a lien on the property. She said this was my fault because I didn&amp;#39;t help her. I manage to talk her down. She then immediately gets fired up again because &amp;quot;they are trying to scam her into giving them all her documents.&amp;quot; Turns out, trial on the matter was coming up in about a week, and they had requested photographs of allegedly unfinished work, damages, etc... as well as the original contract and payment receipts. Basically - all stuff very very typical and reasonable to request and that she is &lt;em&gt;obligated&lt;/em&gt; to provide. She (and nearly every client I worked with in this capacity) thought that evidence was supposed to be a &amp;quot;surprise&amp;quot; at trial and that sharing this information would hurt her case. NO shit it would hurt her case because she is a liar. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, again. Not her lawyer. Actually make her sign a paper signifying she understands this. She leaves. Months pass, I&amp;#39;m no longer at Legal Aid. Lady finds me at my school. I get a call from the fucking dean asking me to swing by. Says he just met with a disgruntled client of mine who says I cost her her home, marriage, and children (apparently things went downhill fast). She claimed she would do everything in her power to make sure I never did anything again. Anyyyways, dean is a nice guy and helped me with my restraining order paperwork. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TL:DR&lt;/em&gt; - First &amp;quot;client&amp;quot; ever was some crazy lady lying psycho who keept thinking I&amp;#39;m her lawyer. She Loses everything, stalks &amp;amp; threatens me, gets restraining order filed against her. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Either that or the time somebody wanted me to sue their ex&amp;#39;s infant for lost sleep. I actually laughed because I thought they were joking. They weren&amp;#39;t. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2shkej", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462403035.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462374235.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3565}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hu6w2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 15, "parent_id": "t1_d2slg1m", "id": "d2tfhm8", "name": "t1_d2tfhm8", "children": ["d2tfhm8", "d2thr9i", "d2ssgy1", "d2tg9vx", "d2te3io", "d2tnt22", "d2ta6bf"]}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2slg1m", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Tnpenguin717", "parent_id": "t3_4hu6w2", "score": 202, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Late to the party but I have two both I will admit are friends rather than myself.\n\nThe first case is the case of the Donkey F***er.

There were no signs anywhere and AFAIK it is within the city limits of Austin. Seriously, where the fuck are you supposed to park? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then there is the one where I live now. The head of it lives across the street, and he and his wife are retired, so they have nothing better to do than catch people violating ordinances. My wife hates power lawnmowers, so we bought an &amp;quot;acoustic&amp;quot; push mower, the kinds that spins the blades when you push it. We get a notice that our landlord is raising the rent $50 per month, then come to find out it&amp;#39;s to pay a lawn service to cut our grass during the summer. Turns out HOA boy didn&amp;#39;t like the look of the cut with the mower we were using. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; I didn&amp;#39;t expect so many people to respond to this.

Lawsuit says I'm in unlawful possession of someone else's property. What? So, I sent a letter to my title company and told them to handle it. No problem. They hired a lawyer who responded.\n\nBackground: Some guy that owned the house 10 or 15 years before had lost it in a lawsuit judgement. The house was quickly sold off. Later, the lawsuit was over turned and he wanted his property back (this part took place in Dixie County to give you an idea of what type of court dealings were going on).

When purchasing I got title insurance from First American Title (at the time, the seller suggested I use them because that&amp;#39;s who HE used and they did a great job). 3 weeks after buying the place, I get served by a Sheriff. Lawsuit says I&amp;#39;m in unlawful possession of someone else&amp;#39;s property. What? So, I sent a letter to my title company and told them to handle it. No problem. They hired a lawyer who responded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Background: Some guy that owned the house 10 or 15 years before had lost it in a lawsuit judgement. The house was quickly sold off. Later, the lawsuit was over turned and he wanted his property back (this part took place in Dixie County to give you an idea of what type of court dealings were going on).

I met with a man a few years ago who was certain that his mother's lawyer had embezzled funds from trust accounts, of which he was the beneficiary. He was in my office with a friend and seemed reasonably well adjusted at first. He was about forty, African American and seemed nice enough, so I listened attentively to his concerns. \n\nThen it started to descend into madness as I asked him about the trust and why it was established. He told me, with a completely honest tone and straight face, that it was money he'd made in the recording industry as a child. Hmm, I thought, this could be interesting. Still thinking the man across the table from me to be sane, I asked what type of music he'd recorded. \n\nThat's when he dropped the real truth on me. He was actually Michael Jackson. THE Michael Jackson. The King of Pop. I told him that couldn't be, since Jackson had recently died. He immediately, and without hesitation proceeded to explain that when I'd heard that Jackson died, he actually awakened, back in this, his real body. He had always been Michael Jackson, but had to hide out in the other body for years. Not wanting to contradict this seemingly unhinged man unnecessarily, I played along for a bit and continued asking questions about the trust and his past. \n\nBut, there was more. This man proceeded to describe to me the custody battle he was having with his baby's mother, who was in fact Serena Williams. He told me about the time, in a hotel bar in Dallas, that Michael Jordan, yes Michael Jordan had confided in him that he was actually his real farther. Of course, this conversation happened while having drinks with his good friend Tiger Woods. I was floored.  He was clear eyed, and didn't seem to be under the influence of anything.

I met with a man a few years ago who was certain that his mother&amp;#39;s lawyer had embezzled funds from trust accounts, of which he was the beneficiary. He was in my office with a friend and seemed reasonably well adjusted at first. He was about forty, African American and seemed nice enough, so I listened attentively to his concerns. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then it started to descend into madness as I asked him about the trust and why it was established. He told me, with a completely honest tone and straight face, that it was money he&amp;#39;d made in the recording industry as a child. Hmm, I thought, this could be interesting. Still thinking the man across the table from me to be sane, I asked what type of music he&amp;#39;d recorded. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s when he dropped the real truth on me. He was actually Michael Jackson. THE Michael Jackson. The King of Pop. I told him that couldn&amp;#39;t be, since Jackson had recently died. He immediately, and without hesitation proceeded to explain that when I&amp;#39;d heard that Jackson died, he actually awakened, back in this, his real body. He had always been Michael Jackson, but had to hide out in the other body for years. Not wanting to contradict this seemingly unhinged man unnecessarily, I played along for a bit and continued asking questions about the trust and his past. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, there was more. This man proceeded to describe to me the custody battle he was having with his baby&amp;#39;s mother, who was in fact Serena Williams. He told me about the time, in a hotel bar in Dallas, that Michael Jordan, yes Michael Jordan had confided in him that he was actually his real farther. Of course, this conversation happened while having drinks with his good friend Tiger Woods. I was floored.  He was clear eyed, and didn&amp;#39;t seem to be under the influence of anything. If he hadn&amp;#39;t just said the things he&amp;#39;d said, you a would never know he wasn&amp;#39;t all there.
