Philosophical arguments are explored through easily accessible constructs. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a hard to accurately describe the book in so few words, but it&amp;#39;s nearly impossible to put down once you get into it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2ol2d6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462151724.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462122924.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 13}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4h8zag", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 1, "parent_id": "t1_d2ohdad", "id": "d2ohz15", "name": "t1_d2ohz15", "children": ["d2ohz15"]}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2ohdad", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "seveneintnine", "parent_id": "t3_4h8zag", "score": 10, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Shantaram and the mountain shadow - a brilliant novel telling the partly true story of Lin; an Australian criminal who escapes a high security prison and flees to India where he moves to the slum where he sets up a clinic, gets involved in the mafia, and fights on the frontline in Afghanistan.
