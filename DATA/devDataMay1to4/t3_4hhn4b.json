Everything smelled of mold and mildew, as if the place had not been cleaned for years. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A shadow of a figure appeared in the doorway, seemingly out of nowhere and addressed him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Welcome to Hell&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; Said the figure, with no hint of emotion in its thick and raspy voice.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Hell?!?&amp;quot; I am in hell?!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;  Exclaimed Ted as he got up to his feet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The figure said nothing as Ted continued to make sense of it all.\n*\n&amp;quot;What happened? How did I get here? Why am I in hell?!* Ted started to scream.\n*&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Please, only one question at a time, you have all of eternity to determine the answers to those questions, lets not get in a huff on your first day&amp;quot;* replied the figure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ted took a deep breath and tried to slow his breathing, taking stock of his life and trying to figure out what landed him in hell. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I Don&amp;#39;t understand, I was a model citizen, never broke any laws, I volunteered at the local homeless shelter 5 nights a week, I attended church and was a devout Christian, I was kind to my fellow man,  I never hit my wife, I was a loving husband and father...  Why am I in hell?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; said Ted. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The figure sighed and gestured to the rooms television, a old CRT that appeared at first glance to be broken, but sprang to life, showing Ted and his then infant son at a bus stop and Ted changing his sons diaper.   Ted watched in silence as the Ted on the screen finished the diaper change, tossed the dirty diaper at a nearby trashcan, missing it by a few feet before taking his son and getting on the bus without attending to the diaper. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Television turned off as suddenly as it had come on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;THIS?!?!?!? THIS IS WHY I AM IN HELL!?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Yelled Ted? \n*&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I Don&amp;#39;t make the rules, I am just here to give you your orientation&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; Replied the figure.   &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;There are ways you can ascend to heaven to be with your family, but you will need to work with your fellow hellmates and determine that on your own, now I must go.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And with that, the figure vanished. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A man rounded the corner, and was startled to see Ted standing in the doorway of the hotel room.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;A new arrival?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; The man asked&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ted nodded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot; The first few decades are the hardest, but once you figure out the system its not as bad as you might think.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ted recoiled slightly at the mention of decades. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;How did you end up here?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; Asked Ted, &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The man shifted uncomfortably.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I was talking on the phone at the theater....&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; The man replied.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was going to be a long stay at Hell. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2psaif", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462235799.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462206999.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 19}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hhn4b", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2pvz0r", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "josh_the_misanthrope", "parent_id": "t1_d2pnwrv", "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Was I supposed to think the poop bunny left them?", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Was I supposed to think the poop bunny left them?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2pvz0r", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462240531.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462211731.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hhn4b", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hhn4b", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2purcm", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "JoelNesv", "parent_id": "t1_d2psd8z", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I live in Los Angeles.
