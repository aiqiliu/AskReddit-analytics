I see people all over the planet shooting into space and had like a tail of bright light behind them and all of us were shooting into the furthest depths of space in all different directions, some were scared and trying to grab onto another, some like myself were calm and at peace. I remember thinking it was an awesome ride. Then this light got brighter and brighter, and i felt very uncomfortable and even scared by this light. I opened my eyes and was just like &amp;quot;i think maybe i went a little too deep.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next time I have a lucid dream, I&amp;#39;m going to try to be braver and meditate again and see if i could go further.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2qbqc7", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462260721.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462231921.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 10}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hkb3z", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hkb3z", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hkb3z", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2qd7ai", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Thatonepsycho", "parent_id": "t1_d2qcny5", "score": 9, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Considering the mannequin was naked I think I may have to wish to become a nudist...", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering the mannequin was naked I think I may have to wish to become a nudist...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2qd7ai", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462262949.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462234149.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hkb3z", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hkb3z", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hkb3z", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2r8ysy", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "fridgeridoo", "parent_id": "t1_d2r8kmf", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "They must not believe in the extra protein!", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;They must not believe in the extra protein!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2r8ysy", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462325075.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462296275.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2r8kmf", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "my_so_called_life", "parent_id": "t1_d2qsm79", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Just think of the people who made that site.

She spent a month in the hospital and eventually was forced to be sedated and put on a respirator for 2 weeks because she couldn&amp;#39;t breathe on her own.  Unfortunately, my grandmother had such presence of mind that she was fully aware that this was happening and gave us a timeline of when she wished to be taken off. I had never seen her so lifeless than when she was on those machines. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She passed of a mysterious bacterial infection in her lungs a day after her 87th birthday, almost as if she was telling us, &amp;quot;Ok guys, I tried. I think this is the perfect time to go.&amp;quot; She wasn&amp;#39;t pulled off of the breathing machines. She just stopped breathing on her own. This was incredibly devastating to us because of how vibrant and lively she was and then all of a sudden, wasn&amp;#39;t. Anyway, after she passed, my cousin and I were very depressed, especially him. He would break down crying anywhere he thought of her. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One night he had a dream that he was in a greenhouse somewhere. He said that it was bright and sunny and smelled like oranges. As he wandered around he found my grandmother, beautiful as ever, with her hands in the dirt, there in the greenhouse gardening with a smile on her face. He said she didn&amp;#39;t say anything but he knew (the way that you somehow know in dreams) that she was showing him how to garden. The one thing he remembers the most was that it was an incredible peace, the kind you only feel at home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since that dream he and I have had incredible peace knowing that that is where my Grandmother is, happy and no longer in pain. I always wish that I could have a dream like that just to see her again. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2qjqi2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462272343.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462243543.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hkb3z", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2qju08", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "weedful_things", "parent_id": "t3_4hkb3z", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "My brothers and some friends and I decided to go skydiving.

Incoming wall of text:\n\nWhen I was young, I lived near Hillsborough State Park in Florida, and they have this historical wooden fort, Fort Foster.  This fort has a very large, cleared, flat, grassy plains all the way around it with thick tree lines of the forest a few hundred meters back.\n\nIn the dream, I am entering this Fort with many people, but all are dirty and decrepit, with the look of fear in their eyes that my slumbering mind cannot understand, but can feel.  At this point I always become anxious, wondering what has these refugees, and that's what they look like, refugees, filing into this old almost two century old wooden fort as if it could be salvation.\n\nIt's as I cross the threshold of the forts wall, that I begin to understand why.  A piercing cry sounds in the distant woods;  a vocalization that was both humanoid and completely inhuman at the same time.\n\nAnother cry sounds, and another - more and more, thousands, millions...and then they come.  Creatures that look like a twisted, thin versions of the Goblins from Lord of the Rings.  As if Guillermo del Torro had envisioned them after the style of creature used in Pan's Labyrinth.\n\nThe tree line splits and out they come in droves, rabid, frothing at the mouth.  Skin the color of charcoal with an oily texture shining palely in the sun - beady eyes like dark acorns piercing the refugees as they begin to run.\n\nFrom the fort a group of men emerge with old time swords and axes, things that would look at home in in the 15th and 16th century, but they are grossly outnumbered and fall quickly.  I can hear the screams of the dying and injured, and the sound of flesh being ripped and torn as the creatures begin to eat the victims.\n\nSuddenly, a large guttural scream rips across the plains and the distant trees shake and shiver, leaves falling to the ground in streams.\n\nThe creatures stop instantly and retreat to the forest, but as they do, the trees part and what can only be described as a Minotaur steps out, leaving fallen and split pines in his wake.  This beast stands as tall as the trees, it's horn twisting around it's head like a split crown, and dark fluid leaks from it's nostrils and mouth.\n\nIt begins to walk forward, almost silently but with a deep impact that can be felt in the ground, even in the small buildings of the fort, where refugees and I hide.  Usually by now I have armed myself with something - wood broken from the fort wall by the goblins and fashioned as a club, one of the daggers that the creatures had carried, or a weapon of the fallen guards, but it's is suddenly very dark, and I cannot even see the weapon in my hands.\n\nSoft rustling can be heard and that deep, rhythmic thump of the approaching Minotaur can still be felt slowly plodding toward the fort.  It feels like hours, this part, as is the way of dreams and as we wait for death, the sky turns darker yet.\n\nThis is when I can take control.

Incoming wall of text:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I was young, I lived near Hillsborough State Park in Florida, and they have this historical wooden fort, Fort Foster.  This fort has a very large, cleared, flat, grassy plains all the way around it with thick tree lines of the forest a few hundred meters back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the dream, I am entering this Fort with many people, but all are dirty and decrepit, with the look of fear in their eyes that my slumbering mind cannot understand, but can feel.  At this point I always become anxious, wondering what has these refugees, and that&amp;#39;s what they look like, refugees, filing into this old almost two century old wooden fort as if it could be salvation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s as I cross the threshold of the forts wall, that I begin to understand why.  A piercing cry sounds in the distant woods;  a vocalization that was both humanoid and completely inhuman at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another cry sounds, and another - more and more, thousands, millions...and then they come.  Creatures that look like a twisted, thin versions of the Goblins from Lord of the Rings.  As if Guillermo del Torro had envisioned them after the style of creature used in Pan&amp;#39;s Labyrinth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The tree line splits and out they come in droves, rabid, frothing at the mouth.  Skin the color of charcoal with an oily texture shining palely in the sun - beady eyes like dark acorns piercing the refugees as they begin to run.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From the fort a group of men emerge with old time swords and axes, things that would look at home in in the 15th and 16th century, but they are grossly outnumbered and fall quickly.  I can hear the screams of the dying and injured, and the sound of flesh being ripped and torn as the creatures begin to eat the victims.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, a large guttural scream rips across the plains and the distant trees shake and shiver, leaves falling to the ground in streams.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The creatures stop instantly and retreat to the forest, but as they do, the trees part and what can only be described as a Minotaur steps out, leaving fallen and split pines in his wake.  This beast stands as tall as the trees, it&amp;#39;s horn twisting around it&amp;#39;s head like a split crown, and dark fluid leaks from it&amp;#39;s nostrils and mouth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It begins to walk forward, almost silently but with a deep impact that can be felt in the ground, even in the small buildings of the fort, where refugees and I hide.  Usually by now I have armed myself with something - wood broken from the fort wall by the goblins and fashioned as a club, one of the daggers that the creatures had carried, or a weapon of the fallen guards, but it&amp;#39;s is suddenly very dark, and I cannot even see the weapon in my hands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Soft rustling can be heard and that deep, rhythmic thump of the approaching Minotaur can still be felt slowly plodding toward the fort.  It feels like hours, this part, as is the way of dreams and as we wait for death, the sky turns darker yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is when I can take control.

I opened one door that looked like a maintenance closet, and saw what looked like a translucent, shimmering, spirit-like entity (rather like a white dementor).\n\nI was remarkably calm about this, and called my friend over to stare at this thing for a few minutes. Tiring of this, we closed the door on it and opened the door at the end of the hall.\n\nThis led us to the outdoor hallway of my school, where we stood among rows of lockers. Oddly, where the restrooms normally stood by the foot of the stairs was a small garden, complete with butterflies and a fountain. \n\nWe stood there taking all this in, and presently we noticed two kangaroos come into view, one red and one blue. As we puzzled over them, I felt something touch my leg and looked down to see what I can only describe as a giant mud dauber perched on my leg. I jumped back at this, and instead of just falling backwards a foot or so, I suddenly found myself standing among the clouds, facing downwards on the side of the tallest skyscraper in the universe.\n\nAbout the time this was all registering in my mind, the \"mud dauber\" flew up beside me, and before I could move jabbed me with its pointy legs (it didn't sting, for some reason) and I woke up right away.\n\nI don't remember all my dreams, but the ones I do I recall very vividly.

We opened the large door at the end, to see a basketball gym that seemed to stretch for eternity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We decided there was no way we were going to attempt crossing that room, and started trying other doors. I opened one door that looked like a maintenance closet, and saw what looked like a translucent, shimmering, spirit-like entity (rather like a white dementor).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was remarkably calm about this, and called my friend over to stare at this thing for a few minutes. Tiring of this, we closed the door on it and opened the door at the end of the hall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This led us to the outdoor hallway of my school, where we stood among rows of lockers. Oddly, where the restrooms normally stood by the foot of the stairs was a small garden, complete with butterflies and a fountain. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We stood there taking all this in, and presently we noticed two kangaroos come into view, one red and one blue. As we puzzled over them, I felt something touch my leg and looked down to see what I can only describe as a giant mud dauber perched on my leg. I jumped back at this, and instead of just falling backwards a foot or so, I suddenly found myself standing among the clouds, facing downwards on the side of the tallest skyscraper in the universe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About the time this was all registering in my mind, the &amp;quot;mud dauber&amp;quot; flew up beside me, and before I could move jabbed me with its pointy legs (it didn&amp;#39;t sting, for some reason) and I woke up right away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t remember all my dreams, but the ones I do I recall very vividly. This was probably my most complex one by far.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2qozcs", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462281874.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462253074.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hkb3z", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2qp6k7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "somali_pirate", "parent_id": "t3_4hkb3z", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I have a few but they all end up with me dying.
