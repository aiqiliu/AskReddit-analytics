Once a woman answered the door covered on blood, another time a man offered me a hit of meth as a tip. But this one is possibly one of the weirdest\n\n\n\nThere was a man who ordered *every single day* at around 6 PM. According to the day driver, he also ordered at 11 AM when the store opened. So that's twice a day. Every time he placed an order he'd order two 2-litres of full calorie Pepsi, then for his food he would switch between ordering two sandwiches or a large stuffed crust pizza with cheesey breadsticks. If you thought the quantity of food was disgusting, just wait.\n\n\nI hated delivering to this man. He lived in a gated community and he would never buzz me in, so I would have to either park on the curb and hop the fence, or wait for someone to come in so I could sneak in after them. He lived on the first floor in a far back corner. There was nothing on his patio, and there was always heavy shades drawn to keep out the light. A sheen of grease always sparkled away on his doorknob, and you could always hear the wheezing before you even approached the door.\n\n\n\nWhen you knocked, the door would immediately open a crack, like he has been standing there waiting. And he had. This man had his couch pulled up next to the door, close enough that the door would not open all the way, but I could still pass the 2-litres through. I wad never prepared for the smell. It was the worst thing I had smelled, or probably will smell, in my life. The tiny opening in the door would unleash this powerful stench. Like a full outhouse had been left in the heat for weeks, and a few raccoons had crawled in and drowned.

Once a woman answered the door covered on blood, another time a man offered me a hit of meth as a tip. But this one is possibly one of the weirdest&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was a man who ordered &lt;em&gt;every single day&lt;/em&gt; at around 6 PM. According to the day driver, he also ordered at 11 AM when the store opened. So that&amp;#39;s twice a day. Every time he placed an order he&amp;#39;d order two 2-litres of full calorie Pepsi, then for his food he would switch between ordering two sandwiches or a large stuffed crust pizza with cheesey breadsticks. If you thought the quantity of food was disgusting, just wait.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hated delivering to this man. He lived in a gated community and he would never buzz me in, so I would have to either park on the curb and hop the fence, or wait for someone to come in so I could sneak in after them. He lived on the first floor in a far back corner. There was nothing on his patio, and there was always heavy shades drawn to keep out the light. A sheen of grease always sparkled away on his doorknob, and you could always hear the wheezing before you even approached the door.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you knocked, the door would immediately open a crack, like he has been standing there waiting. And he had. This man had his couch pulled up next to the door, close enough that the door would not open all the way, but I could still pass the 2-litres through. I wad never prepared for the smell. It was the worst thing I had smelled, or probably will smell, in my life. The tiny opening in the door would unleash this powerful stench.

I calmly explained that I was delivering his pizza, and some (large) woman moved him out of the way (knife still pointed at me) and she takes the pizzas. Door swings open more and I see like 10 people around the coffee table freebasing something (I am now pretty sure that it was crack) and infomercials were on the TV, all the lights were off. The woman told me that she called my boss and the pizzas were free because I was late, but since I got there in like 5 minutes and my boss was on the stingy side, I told her I didn&amp;#39;t believe her. She threw some money at me (5 bucks short), slammed the door, and I told my boss I wasn&amp;#39;t going to the Studio Six anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Knife pulled on me while delivering pizzas, saw people freebasing drugs, still made them pay, noped out of there.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2sn70u", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462410435.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462381635.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 255}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hur95", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hur95", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 1, "parent_id": "t1_d2swkjd", "children": ["d2sya46"], "name": "t1_d2sya46", "id": "d2sya46"}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2swkjd", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MajorNoodles", "parent_id": "t1_d2snmsq", "score": 38, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I would love to hear how his wife felt about his creeping.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would love to hear how his wife felt about his creeping.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2swkjd", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462422214.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462393414.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 38}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hur95", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hur95", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 1, "parent_id": "t1_d2t22jv", "id": "d2tbcdw", "name": "t1_d2tbcdw", "children": ["d2tbcdw"]}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2t22jv", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "BusinessPenguin", "parent_id": "t1_d2syspw", "score": 14, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I mean, maybe he never intended to harm her and was just really in exhibitionism.
