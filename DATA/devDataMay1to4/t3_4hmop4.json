At first he falsely told investigators that the fire was started accidentally by a gunshot, but he later recanted and admitted he started the fire intentionally to signal rescuers. After gathering sticks and brush together, Martinez lit the brush and quickly lost containment because of the heat, low humidity and low moisture content of surrounding vegetation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Martinez was charged on October 7, 2004 in federal court with setting the fire and lying about it.[13] On March 10, 2005, Martinez pleaded guilty to deliberately setting fire to timber, in a plea bargain under which the charge of lying to a federal officer was dropped. Although Martinez was directly responsible for the deaths of fifteen people and caused hundreds of millions of dollars in economic and building losses, under a plea bargain, Martinez was only sentenced to six months in minimum-security confinement, which outraged many in San Diego County.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedar_Fire\"&gt;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedar_Fire&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2qza86", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462311738.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462282938.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 881}}, {"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 49, "parent_id": "t1_d2qwd35", "children": ["d2r24xt", "d2r737p", "d2r4ykm", "d2rc6ix", "d2r3uoa", "d2rkutn", "d2r7atw", "d2r2wid", "d2r2yse", "d2rb40v", "d2r51r5", "d2r3a6e", "d2rnbja", "d2r1z92", "d2rfnlj", "d2rodkp", "d2r9xoe", "d2r1lj4", "d2qz6x0", "d2r570m", "d2r3xl7", "d2r5o7g", "d2r9cr1", "d2r9zkf", "d2r7dgj", "d2r0b17", "d2r1t2b", "d2qxl2c", "d2r0yg9", "d2r152k", "d2r7pwz", "d2r2lbp", "d2r29di", "d2s3uv2", "d2ra2s5"], "name": "t1_d2r24xt", "id": "d2r24xt"}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2qwd35", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Melzeebub92", "parent_id": "t1_d2qvxpc", "score": 4642, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Did the hunter fuck up or did he make it really easy to find him with the forest gone?", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did the hunter fuck up or did he make it really easy to find him with the forest gone?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2qwd35", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462305931.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462277131.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4642}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hmop4", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 122, "parent_id": "t1_d2qxzvf", "children": ["d2raqsg", "d2r83oh", "d2r138k", "d2rbls6", "d2r8k4q", "d2r4wh8", "d2r5y5p", "d2v2999", "d2rhux6", "d2r6yu6", "d2r2c52", "d2rg33s", "d2rpwvv", "d2r3r19", "d2qzzi6"], "name": "t1_d2raqsg", "id": "d2raqsg"}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2qxzvf", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "isit2003", "parent_id": "t1_d2qvxpc", "score": 950, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Even worse about the Fire of London, so much wood was needed to rebuild that England could not supply it themselves.
