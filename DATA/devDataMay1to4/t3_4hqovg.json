We've had sex four times and checked off a variety of positions. The atmosphere is great, big bed in a dark room with rock lamps and moody music. The foreplay goes on for like an hour before we actually do anything so we're definitely worked up. I think he is incredibly hot and he has expressed similar sentiments. But when we have sex, nothing. It went on for over three hours straight one night until I was hurting so bad I had to pretend I was exhausted to end things for the night. I was literally bleeding the next day.\n\n I've tried everything I know to do, being vocal, not being vocal, grabbing his hair, his back, his biceps, grabbing myself, different paces and rhythms, every position I can think of, and I'm honestly at such a loss now. I tried gently asking him if I could do anything for his enjoyment, and he brushed me off with \"making you come is what gets me off\". Fair to his word, he eats me out a ton and seems very focused on me. I love that but I feel super selfish and a little insecure when he hasn't come once the entire time we've seen each other. I tried oral once and after about two minutes he pulled me up, flipped us over, and went down on me- I took that to mean he wasn't really enjoying himself, which is kind of embarrassing on my part. \n\nI'm not really sure what to do next time I see him. I really love being with him, sexually and not, and I don't want there to be any pressure on him at all, but I can't help feeling like it's my fault somehow. Guys, any ideas? What would you want a girl you were seeing to do in this situation? ", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;ve been seeing a guy who just doesn&amp;#39;t seem to come. We&amp;#39;ve had sex four times and checked off a variety of positions. The atmosphere is great, big bed in a dark room with rock lamps and moody music. The foreplay goes on for like an hour before we actually do anything so we&amp;#39;re definitely worked up. I think he is incredibly hot and he has expressed similar sentiments. But when we have sex, nothing. It went on for over three hours straight one night until I was hurting so bad I had to pretend I was exhausted to end things for the night. I was literally bleeding the next day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve tried everything I know to do, being vocal, not being vocal, grabbing his hair, his back, his biceps, grabbing myself, different paces and rhythms, every position I can think of, and I&amp;#39;m honestly at such a loss now. I tried gently asking him if I could do anything for his enjoyment, and he brushed me off with &amp;quot;making you come is what gets me off&amp;quot;. Fair to his word, he eats me out a ton and seems very focused on me. I love that but I feel super selfish and a little insecure when he hasn&amp;#39;t come once the entire time we&amp;#39;ve seen each other. I tried oral once and after about two minutes he pulled me up, flipped us over, and went down on me- I took that to mean he wasn&amp;#39;t really enjoying himself, which is kind of embarrassing on my part. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not really sure what to do next time I see him. I really love being with him, sexually and not, and I don&amp;#39;t want there to be any pressure on him at all, but I can&amp;#39;t help feeling like it&amp;#39;s my fault somehow. Guys, any ideas?
