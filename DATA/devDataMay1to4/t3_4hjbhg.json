What few friends I had to begin with are back at college and haven't kept contact, and there's nothing to do in this god forsaken town that I am even remotely interested in.

I\u2019m currently doing pretty Ok (see below) and I definitely don\u2019t want to whine around. \n\n\nSo I was sitting here in front of this post for a good couple of minutes and I was really struggling whether I should or shouldn\u2019t post my story. I decided to write down what happened not to gain karma nor to be a attention whore but for a different reason. I need to prepare myself and I\u2019m having difficulties to face my past. I\u2019m writing this with a lump in my throat because the memories still haunt me. But I need to do this and this post is a good motivation to write this down. \n\nThe truth is: On the 4th may I\u2019m meeting a doctor of my health incurance. He will check my physically and mentally and if I\u2019m lucky I will get back my monthly half-orphan\u2019s pension if \u201cI am sick enough\u201d. And he is the one I need to tell my whole story.\n\n**So what happened?** In order to keep this post more or less short I am going to use bullet points (Also because I don\u2019t want to remember more than necessary\u2026). For comparision: I\u2019m female and turning 23 this may 30th.\n\n\u2022\tMy father died when I was 18. It would have been his lung cancer, but eventually he ended his life himself by jumping out of the window because he couldn\u2019t bare the pain anymore and he knew and was told he would die in a few weeks. He did it when nobody was around and that makes me very proud of him. He even contacted the police beforehand to avoid that anybody would find him in this condition.\n\n\u2022\tI met my now ex-husband and moved to him to Germany. I quit college (biology) for him, started studying shit there and became depressed. Had to take anti-depressants. He treated me (emotionally) pretty very, very bad. Like garbage.\n\n\u2022\tBecame badly overweight (worst was 89kg with 1,59m) and started to have health issues.\n\n\u2022\tAfter my father died my whole family father sided wouldn\u2019t talk to me anymore. They didn\u2019t show up at my wedding. And by doing so they stole a big part of my culture. They were from Egypt/Syria and I used to be proud of my family. Now I feel like there is a hole inside of me.\n\n\u2022\tMy dad left me with two restaurants that had massiv depts.\n\n\u2022\tMy half-silblings sued me, because my dad messed up his will. Had to pay them 85k Euros. Had to take a 35k Euros loan and I sold one restaurant.\n\n\u2022\tI had to move back to Vienna to deal with my sueing siblings and lived with my mom for almost 7 months.\n\n\u2022\tMy mother-in-law became lung cancer too and my used-to-be-husband wouldn\u2019t visit me in Vienna. I was too broke to visit him. He had a good job but he didn\u2019t support me financially. He went on holiday with his parents instead of with me.\n\n\u2022\tHe was supposed to move to Vienna and find a job here since I wasn\u2019t able to leave (and I didn\u2019t want to leave because I was way happier here). He was a pussy and to scared and had me wait for a whole year for him until he eventually broke up with me on the 31st december 2015. Everything was settled. I organized him a job, I took care of finding a flat and so on. But hell, I\u2019m lucky that I got rid of this asshole!\n\n\u2022\tDue to the bad influence of my ex-husband me and my mother fought a lot. Our relationship nearly broke.\n\n\u2022\tGot sued by another half-brother of mine. He wants about 85k from me. I don\u2019t have any money, no job and I\u2019m too broke to buy food in the grocery store. I always eat in the restaurant. The amount of money I receive is just enough to pay the bills but nothing more\n\n\u2022\tBecause I wasn\u2019t able to study under such conditions I lost my half-orphan\u2019s pension because I didn\u2019t pass my exams (1. Dad dies; 2. Stepmom has cancer; 3. Husband breaks up with me)\n\n\u2022\tCurrently I suffer from cervical spine syndrome and Sciatica (? In german it\u2019s called lumboischialgie). But luckly I received physiotherapy!\n\n\u2022\tMy dad built a house without permission and now I\u2019m in troubles with building inspectors. Might have to tear the house down. Guess who has to pay.\n\n\u2022\tMy (other) cat was put to sleep after 12 years. :/ My mom is really sad.\n\n\n**Let\u2019s wind forward. 2.05.2016:**\n\nI\u2019m doing pretty good. Sure it could be better, but I\u2019m thankful for what I have now. Everything that happened to me has scarred me pretty badly. But I\u2019m stronger now and I wear those scars with pride. They are my battle scars. Things tried to kill me. Didn\u2019t kill me. Fuck those things. The other restaurant runs pretty good and depts are almost payed off. I have a superfluffy one-year old cat named Sherlock (that\u2019s the other cat) that I love like my little brother, I lost more than 20kg now *flex* and I start to look the way I used to look before that crap happened to me (That means hawt. Huehuehuhehehe). I\u2019m so glad I broke up with this asshole and I look forward to start going out soon with my friends. I\u2019m off my anti-depressants and I start to be happier every day. I\u2019m planning to start studying astrophysics or philosophy this autuum and I can\u2019t wait to dive into university life again! I don\u2019t have much money but due to this I appreciate simple things way more than I used to. Had an awesome ice cream with my mom today. Mango and chocolate. Yum!\n\n+ 20 willpower for everyone who made it that far here! \n\n**The only thing that is left to say is the following:** Mum, I know you will never ever read this. Hell, you don\u2019t even know how to send an email, but that\u2019s ok. I love you very, very much. Without you and your help I probably ended up in jail or I would have remained in a unhappy relationship with an asshole. I can\u2019t even tell you how grateful I am that you took care of everything while I was off my mind. And still you manage the restaurant and do you best so that I can look forward studying. AND yes mom I know you always pay me two euros more when I work as a waitress! I don\u2019t care what\u2019s written on paper. I might be the official owner of the restaurant but it\u2019s actually you who fills this place with love and hard work. Thanks for being such a great manager. I love you mum. Happy mother\u2019s day.\n\n\nTo anyone out there who feels lonely or is in a similar situation. Don\u2019t hesitate to contact me. I\u2019m serious. I\u2019ve been through so much shit, I know that what people often need is just somebody listening. So please write. I\u2019m listening and I know your pain. Don\u2019t give up. I promise you will win in the end. Keep fighting.\n\n\n***Love you redditors. You\u2019re the best community out there!***\n\n\n***Edit:*** Holy shit! That's probably this \"rip mailbox moment\" I heard of! I can't believe I received so much warm  and comforting words! AND GOLD! Thank you so very much. Damn. That gold feels like a gold medal. You guys are awesome. I will read each and every comment and try to answer each one since eveybody who took his/her time to read that deserves a answer. \n\nYou made another human being very happy and made me feel really important. Thank you guys from the bottom of my heart. Love you guys. Keep rocking!", "edited": 1462263698.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;First off I\u2019d like to apologize for my english. I\u2019ll do my best to write comprehensible and without mistakes. Please don\u2019t feel \u201cduty-bound\u201d to upvote this. I\u2019m currently doing pretty Ok (see below) and I definitely don\u2019t want to whine around. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I was sitting here in front of this post for a good couple of minutes and I was really struggling whether I should or shouldn\u2019t post my story. I decided to write down what happened not to gain karma nor to be a attention whore but for a different reason. I need to prepare myself and I\u2019m having difficulties to face my past. I\u2019m writing this with a lump in my throat because the memories still haunt me. But I need to do this and this post is a good motivation to write this down. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The truth is: On the 4th may I\u2019m meeting a doctor of my health incurance. He will check my physically and mentally and if I\u2019m lucky I will get back my monthly half-orphan\u2019s pension if \u201cI am sick enough\u201d. And he is the one I need to tell my whole story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what happened?&lt;/strong&gt; In order to keep this post more or less short I am going to use bullet points (Also because I don\u2019t want to remember more than necessary\u2026). For comparision: I\u2019m female and turning 23 this may 30th.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022 My father died when I was 18. It would have been his lung cancer, but eventually he ended his life himself by jumping out of the window because he couldn\u2019t bare the pain anymore and he knew and was told he would die in a few weeks. He did it when nobody was around and that makes me very proud of him. He even contacted the police beforehand to avoid that anybody would find him in this condition.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022 I met my now ex-husband and moved to him to Germany. I quit college (biology) for him, started studying shit there and became depressed. Had to take anti-depressants. He treated me (emotionally) pretty very, very bad. Like garbage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022 Became badly overweight (worst was 89kg with 1,59m) and started to have health issues.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022 After my father died my whole family father sided wouldn\u2019t talk to me anymore. They didn\u2019t show up at my wedding. And by doing so they stole a big part of my culture. They were from Egypt/Syria and I used to be proud of my family. Now I feel like there is a hole inside of me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022 My dad left me with two restaurants that had massiv depts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022 My half-silblings sued me, because my dad messed up his will. Had to pay them 85k Euros. Had to take a 35k Euros loan and I sold one restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022 I had to move back to Vienna to deal with my sueing siblings and lived with my mom for almost 7 months.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022 My mother-in-law became lung cancer too and my used-to-be-husband wouldn\u2019t visit me in Vienna. I was too broke to visit him. He had a good job but he didn\u2019t support me financially. He went on holiday with his parents instead of with me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022 He was supposed to move to Vienna and find a job here since I wasn\u2019t able to leave (and I didn\u2019t want to leave because I was way happier here). He was a pussy and to scared and had me wait for a whole year for him until he eventually broke up with me on the 31st december 2015. Everything was settled. I organized him a job, I took care of finding a flat and so on. But hell, I\u2019m lucky that I got rid of this asshole!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022 Due to the bad influence of my ex-husband me and my mother fought a lot. Our relationship nearly broke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022 Got sued by another half-brother of mine. He wants about 85k from me. I don\u2019t have any money, no job and I\u2019m too broke to buy food in the grocery store. I always eat in the restaurant. The amount of money I receive is just enough to pay the bills but nothing more&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022 Because I wasn\u2019t able to study under such conditions I lost my half-orphan\u2019s pension because I didn\u2019t pass my exams (1.
