The Bible is full of stories with morals and themes that give people an idea of what a &amp;quot;good person&amp;quot; is supposed to be: polite, compassionate, understanding, etc. I&amp;#39;m atheist, yes, but I love the idea of religion because it&amp;#39;s one of the few things that makes us human. However, I&amp;#39;d prefer to not let it muck up my life regarding who I make friends with, who I avoid, who I choose to date, etc. I&amp;#39;ve matured enough to have developed morals that I understand and follow on a daily basis, so I don&amp;#39;t believe that I have any need for a God to follow or a text to study. I&amp;#39;m a human, and that&amp;#39;s holy enough for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2qhqd7", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462269425.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462240625.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hfuea", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2qpec0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "youyour", "parent_id": "t3_4hfuea", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "As a child I fiercely hoped that there was a god.
