It&amp;#39;s important to keep in mind she was deeply religious and lived less than a quarter mile from her church that she attended almost daily.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So when I asked her, she sounded simultaneously happy and annoyed at the question, as if the answer were obvious. &amp;quot;Oh, we needed the Holocaust. You wouldn&amp;#39;t believe what the Jews did to me and my family growing up. The things we had to go through because of the Jews. They got what was coming.&amp;quot; Add in another 15 minutes of personal and family stories about how terrible Jewish people are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had no idea how to respond to any of it. I said &amp;quot;thanks Grandma,&amp;quot; and made sure to never bring it up or anything like it again.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2rhj8j", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462336081.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462307281.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 282}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hncwt", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hncwt", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hncwt", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hncwt", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hncwt", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2rvjv0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "AJ_Sully", "parent_id": "t1_d2remv3", "score": 13, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm sensing a theme here...", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sensing a theme here...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2rvjv0", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462355359.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462326559.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 13}}, {"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 4, "parent_id": "t1_d2remv3", "children": ["d2rtcu4", "d2rzgaj", "d2rzmdg", "d2slhkp"], "name": "t1_d2rtcu4", "id": "d2rtcu4"}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2remv3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "folkadots", "parent_id": "t1_d2r78zi", "score": 36, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Aileen Wuornos too if I am recalling correctly", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aileen Wuornos too if I am recalling correctly&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2remv3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462332375.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462303575.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 36}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2r78zi", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Icamp2cook", "parent_id": "t1_d2r3c7g", "score": 85, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "And Ted Bundy!", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Ted Bundy!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2r78zi", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462322838.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462294038.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 85}}, {"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 7, "parent_id": "t1_d2r3c7g", "children": ["d2s8ef6", "d2rh76v"], "name": "t1_d2s8ef6", "id": "d2s8ef6"}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2r3c7g", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Martinsimonnet", "parent_id": "t1_d2r13up", "score": 163, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Isn't that also what happened to Jack Nicholson?

We were young (17 &amp; 19), and hit it off, and the only way to stay together was to get married which we both seemed to want, so we went for it.\n\nAt that time, I knew she was 'quirky' but didn't understand the extent that various forms of depression &amp; anxiety come in, and how deep they truly are.\n\nAfter the marriage, we flew to my home state, completely uprooting her and putting her in a VERY awkward and uncomfortable situation with new people, strange places, etc.  \n\nThe day after our wedding was her 18th birthday and I knew that she never really had a birthday party growing up, so what a better way to do it than a SURPRISE PARTY!  Yeah, you see where this is going...\n\nThis was back in my drinking days, and I was pretty lubed up at the time this happened (I'm gonna use that as an excuse).  She was sitting on the couch, around all these strangers, and I was standing behind her. \n\nMy mom came out with a birthday cake and everyone started singing Happy Birthday.  \n\nKnowing what I do NOW, I would never consider this, but at the time it seemed like a great idea.\n\nAnyhow, back to the story.  Well, the anxiety got to be too much for her and she reached back to grab me, just for some comfort.  Problem is, she grabbed my dick and clamped down like a fucking gator on a redneck's arm.  \n\nMy reaction was to kinda boot her in the back of the head with my stocking foot, sending her running to the garage with the rest of the family awkwardly finishing out \"Happy Birthday to you....\".\n\nSpent about an hour calming her down.

We were young (17 &amp;amp; 19), and hit it off, and the only way to stay together was to get married which we both seemed to want, so we went for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At that time, I knew she was &amp;#39;quirky&amp;#39; but didn&amp;#39;t understand the extent that various forms of depression &amp;amp; anxiety come in, and how deep they truly are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After the marriage, we flew to my home state, completely uprooting her and putting her in a VERY awkward and uncomfortable situation with new people, strange places, etc.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The day after our wedding was her 18th birthday and I knew that she never really had a birthday party growing up, so what a better way to do it than a SURPRISE PARTY!  Yeah, you see where this is going...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was back in my drinking days, and I was pretty lubed up at the time this happened (I&amp;#39;m gonna use that as an excuse).  She was sitting on the couch, around all these strangers, and I was standing behind her. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mom came out with a birthday cake and everyone started singing Happy Birthday.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Knowing what I do NOW, I would never consider this, but at the time it seemed like a great idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, back to the story.  Well, the anxiety got to be too much for her and she reached back to grab me, just for some comfort.  Problem is, she grabbed my dick and clamped down like a fucking gator on a redneck&amp;#39;s arm.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My reaction was to kinda boot her in the back of the head with my stocking foot, sending her running to the garage with the rest of the family awkwardly finishing out &amp;quot;Happy Birthday to you....&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spent about an hour calming her down.  Made it through the night, and here we are 26 yrs later.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2recqj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462332020.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462303220.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 172}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hncwt", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 3, "parent_id": "t1_d2rql6k", "id": "d2seqrn", "name": "t1_d2seqrn", "children": ["d2seqrn", "d2s89df"]}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2rql6k", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "UndeadKitten", "parent_id": "t3_4hncwt", "score": 34, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "That my grandmother married a man who raped and molested her kids, and knew it was happening.
