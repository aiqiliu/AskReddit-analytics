On the way home, however, I decided to take the highway to make better time, as I was starting to feel my sleep deficit. I remember most of the ride. I remember the landmarks as I got closer to home. I remember thinking to myself that my exit would be coming up in a few miles. I remember looking forward to getting home and sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next thing I remember is being on the far side of the city, probably about ten miles past my exit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That experience freaked me the fuck out, and still does a little. I&amp;#39;ve never remembered anything from those ~10 minutes, and I have no idea how close I may have come to dying during that time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2pt7lr", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462237007.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462208207.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 22}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hga70", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hga70", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hga70", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hga70", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2q070r", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ExpiredPlate", "parent_id": "t1_d2pwbwx", "score": 26, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "By not revealing their condition", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;By not revealing their condition&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2q070r", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462245873.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462217073.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 26}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hga70", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2q2gux", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Beetrain", "parent_id": "t1_d2pwbwx", "score": 12, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Pretty easy.
