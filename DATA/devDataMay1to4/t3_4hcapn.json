Had the same deal with business statistics.  There were two professors teaching it and one used software (but not Excel) and the other preferred doing obscure calculations without any context, all from scratch and memory, using a graphing calculator.  She even placed restrictions on how advanced a calculator could be, which screwed me bad because I ended up on an unfamiliar calculator that I wasn&amp;#39;t proficient on and that I would never use again, even once.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The good professor&amp;#39;s classes always filled up very early and I couldn&amp;#39;t register until late due to not knowing my schedule at work, so I got stuck with the difficult prof not once (F), but twice (F), and then lucked out on a new professor who taught entirely in Excel and customized problems to teach concepts and also business applications (A).  He was awesome.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wrote him such a glowing positive teacher&amp;#39;s evaluation toward the end of the semester that he addressed it in the final lecture with total incredulity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The way I see it is that his being there probably kept me from failing the course three times and getting washed out of business school.  OTOH, in retrospect, I kind of wish that that had happened.  I don&amp;#39;t feel like that credential has helped me much.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2p6jvk", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462185489.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462156689.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 17}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hcapn", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 9, "parent_id": "t1_d2pb57g", "children": ["d2pnps8", "d2puyf0", "d2ph10s", "d2pix4m", "d2pecrr"], "name": "t1_d2pnps8", "id": "d2pnps8"}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2pb57g", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "neutronfish", "parent_id": "t1_d2oz3w3", "score": 11, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Not discrete math?
