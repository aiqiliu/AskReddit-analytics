I had absolutely no friends due to pathological shyness and I put on about 20 pounds within those first 2 years. Junior year was tough academically, but I found a friend group that I really belonged in. I lost a lot of the weight I had gained as well. Senior year was the absolute best, didn&amp;#39;t worry as much about grades and had a lot of time to spend with friends. I felt like I had life figured out and the world was my oyster.   &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2t8kb5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462439437.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462410637.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hxmbd", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2t8oby", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Loves_me_tacos125", "parent_id": "t3_4hxmbd", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Slow, just a small group of 5 close friends, wasn't popular but wasn't considered a loner either ", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slow, just a small group of 5 close friends, wasn&amp;#39;t popular but wasn&amp;#39;t considered a loner either &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2t8oby", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462439611.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462410811.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hxmbd", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2t8ykt", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "abalone_sammich", "parent_id": "t3_4hxmbd", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "It was four of the worst years of my life.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was four of the worst years of my life.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2t8ykt", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462440049.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462411249.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hxmbd", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2t92hj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ohwontyouthrowmeaway", "parent_id": "t3_4hxmbd", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Nothing like college or real life.
