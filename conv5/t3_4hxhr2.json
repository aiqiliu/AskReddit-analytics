But when I was in high school I got my phone taken away (I was grounded for sneaking out) and my dad let me use his personal cellphone while I was at school or work. One day I was going through it and somehow stumbled across his gangbang porn stash. It was incredibly uncomfortable especially because I&amp;#39;m a girl and my dad is a very straight laced Catholic. To this day he doesn&amp;#39;t know I found it and I haven&amp;#39;t told anyone (till now). &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2tfqmt", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462451718.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462422918.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 14}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hxhr2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hxhr2", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2teov3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Halocaptain1", "parent_id": "t1_d2tdict", "score": 12, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Obviously", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2teov3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462449574.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462420774.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 12}}, {"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 12, "parent_id": "t1_d2tdict", "id": "d2thihs", "name": "t1_d2thihs", "children": ["d2thihs", "d2th7kc"]}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2tdict", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "hifromaguy", "parent_id": "t3_4hxhr2", "score": 19, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I dated a chick once who would fuck her brother (obviously found out AFTER we dated, OBVIOUSLY!) \n\nugh, I still feel super weird about it to this day.. we used to get jiggy a lot...", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I dated a chick once who would fuck her brother (obviously found out AFTER we dated, OBVIOUSLY!) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ugh, I still feel super weird about it to this day.. we used to get jiggy a lot...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2tdict", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462447386.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462418586.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 19}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hxhr2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hxhr2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hxhr2", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2tmf8e", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "WtotheSLAM", "parent_id": "t1_d2tg6qf", "score": 4, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yeah.

It's totally disgusting. At least she hasn't started wearing diapers to the office yet, and shitting herself in front of us. Yet. \n\nThe embarrassing thing is: We all know.

First of all, - just for some background: His mom died right when he was born, (she was actually really, really hot, but whatever.) He actually grew up with his dad's family, because his dad has all sorts of emotional issues and he bailed before he was born. His childhood was really kind of messed up. \nI don't want to go into to many details about it, but basically what happened is that he accidentally found a video that she made of herself. All this crazy shit went down and he had to leave home. \n\nSooo... He was totally lusting after his sister at that point. She was also having bad trouble with the law. She was actually in custody when he left home. \n\nMy friend and I went to go pick her up. When he saw her that day, after seeing this *certain* video of her, he wanted to fuck her brains out, you could tell. Looking back on it now, it's pretty messed up- but I think she had feelings for him too. She actually kissed him right after we came to get her... and it wasn't a sisterly kiss, you know? I mean, it wasn't like ridiculously sexual or anything, but it definitely wasn't sisterly. \n\nAfter we left, we all went to crash with his Sister's friends. On the trip there, another friend sort of implied that he wanted to get with his Sister, and he got a little jealous. He's a good looking guy- and even though she was his sister- he just felt like he was competition. Not much else happened between them for a while except some maybe-sexy hugging. \n\nMy friend and his sister never hooked up I don't think- but I thought there was some serious sexual tension going on between them. It was around that time that he got really badly hurt in an accident.  He almost died. But when he was in recovery his sister came to see him, and out of the clear blue sky she started giving him this awesome, slow, passionate kiss on the lips. \n\nNothing ever came of it. They spent some time apart... and he started to get really religious.\nA little while later she actually wound up with my friend from before (the sexual tension guy). I can't say I was surprised. \n\nBut even after she was shacking up with my friend, there was one time we were all at a party... my friend was inside, and his sister and him were outside alone. It was a really intimate moment.
