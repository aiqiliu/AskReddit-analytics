I don't know.  Just to make a point I recently took an assignment for school requiring us to give a speech and made Trump the topic, explaining many things about his policies and traits that would positively affect America just to be sure they actually understood him (I don't think many republicans refusing to vote for him actually know shit about him).\n\nIf anything else, I explained that their vote wouldn't just result in a democrat getting the office, but also a liberal supreme court justice getting chosen instead of a conservative, but they don't seem to get it.  They just don't like his personality and that's it.  Another reason is probably moral because he's had several divorces and our community is all Christian, but I couldn't care less about either reason.  He'd be the president, not my friend or psychiatrist.\n\nSome important points for you republicans here opting to not vote Trump from my 16 year old brain.\n\n- He is self-financed.  He is not influenced by third party lobbyists.  He wants close up the tax loopholes that let the rich avoid paying their share, and no businesses can threaten to stop funding him if he does.\n\n- He's a businessman and will attack the deficit like one.  He understands economics more thoroughly than you or I could hope to and has experienced the ups and downs of business so he relates more than you think (filed for bankruptcy four times).\n\n- Has an open mind.  He's willing to examine the facts and make changes to his ideology.  He used to identify as a liberal and now as a moderate conservative.\n\n- His personality is actually perfect.  He stands firmly for what he believes and says what he thinks no matter what anyone else thinks about it.\n\n- Compare him to Ronald Reagan.  Reagan was a great president and is very much the same as Trump, known for answering complex problems with simple solutions (something Trump gets attacked for).  Reagan did a lot of things that everyone didn't like, but it all worked.  He said \"tear down this wall,\" and BAM, who do we attribute the destruction of that wall to?  He cut taxes to decrease the deficit - everyone told him no, everyone was like \"hey, you can't do that,\" everyone said it's not working, and he said wait a little longer - and it finally worked (like how people say Trump's financial plans are ridiculous).  Reagan was also slandered by the liberal media in the exact same way Trump is now.  Maybe you don't know, but he was a great president, and I think all the signs are saying Trump will be too.\n\n- He's got a head on his shoulders.  Calls bullshit on bullshit.  Doesn't give a damn about political correctness, which has been destroying our system for years.\n\n- Will get rid of interstate health insurance lines.  Right now, you can't purchase health insurance outside of your state.  This obviously leads to monopolies and higher costs for healthcare.\n\n- Again, is a good businessman.  Doesn't like the TTP, Obamacare, or the fact we pay over 70% of the UN's budget.  He'll change all that unlike the democrats.\n\nEDIT: Hit the save button and didn't finish my list.  Anyway, there's a lot more to it, but just dwell on the few things I listed and do some research yourself.\n\nEDIT 2:  I have shit to do.
