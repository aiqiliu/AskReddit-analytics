The three biggest problems I have with Trump are his Lying/position changing, his unrealistic  tax plan, and most importantly his hate-mongering.\n\nThe main positions trump has flipped on were his position on assault weapon bans, killing terrorist families, Syrian refuges, punishing women who get abortions, and saying he didn't know who David Duke was/refusing to denounce him and his support.\n\n The second point, taxes by far the most complicated and because I'm not an expert in tax law I can only go off the conclusions of people who are. Here is the [link](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/analysis-donald-trumps-tax-plan/full) to the very detailed analysis of Trump's tax plan which I admittedly skimmed, but I will take a quote out of the conclusion section;  \"The fundamental concern the plan poses is that, barring extraordinarily large cuts in government spending or future tax increases, it would yield persistently large, and likely unsustainable, budget deficits\". This is just a slice of the paper (which contained some pros to Trump's tax plan) but I figured I would just link to the source instead of trying to summarize something that I am not at all qualified to. \n\nThe final point that I will touch on is the hate mongering. Trump constantly uses fear of minorities in order to build support for himself. The whole idea of building a wall, which he constantly pushes, is built on the back of xenophobia towards Mexicans. He has called for restrictions on muslim immigration, which is clearly islamophobic and a violation of the idea of separation of church and state.  He has encouraged violence at his rally against protesters, excusing his two of his supporters for attacking a homeless  man by saying that they were \"very passionate\", saying \" If you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would you? Seriously. Okay? Just knock the hell \u2014 I promise you, I will pay for the legal fees.\u201d, \u201cI\u2019d like to punch [a protester] in the face, I\u2019ll tell ya\u201d, \"\u201cMaybe [a protester who was attacked by several trump supporters] should have been roughed up because it was absolutely disgusting what he was doing.\u201d These are only things that Trump has defended, but I think that the worse part is that he has not condemn the most terrible acts his supporters have committed, such as a supporter yelling [\"go to fucking auschwitz\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOteZSaejh8) and another supporter saying [go back Africa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oe8aLgbO98). I can't support any candidate who doesn't completely condemn this type of behavior, and as a minority it terrifies me that a person who thinks it is ok to act like this is running for President of the United States of America (though my ethnicity has not been actively attacked by Trump except for a few remarks). I don't know if Mr. Trump honestly believes what he says about Mexicans/ muslims or if he is just using it to get support, but honestly I don't give a fuck. This may not have been the most coherent post, but I hope it helps expand my opinion. \n\nP.S. That's *Mr.* Rock-Facts to you (:\n\nEdit:formating", "edited": 1462489981.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firstly, i&amp;#39;m not going to pretend I&amp;#39;m an expert at U.S. politics, so there could (and probably are) flaws in my thinking. The three biggest problems I have with Trump are his Lying/position changing, his unrealistic  tax plan, and most importantly his hate-mongering.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The main positions trump has flipped on were his position on assault weapon bans, killing terrorist families, Syrian refuges, punishing women who get abortions, and saying he didn&amp;#39;t know who David Duke was/refusing to denounce him and his support.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The second point, taxes by far the most complicated and because I&amp;#39;m not an expert in tax law I can only go off the conclusions of people who are. Here is the &lt;a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/analysis-donald-trumps-tax-plan/full\"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to the very detailed analysis of Trump&amp;#39;s tax plan which I admittedly skimmed, but I will take a quote out of the conclusion section;  &amp;quot;The fundamental concern the plan poses is that, barring extraordinarily large cuts in government spending or future tax increases, it would yield persistently large, and likely unsustainable, budget deficits&amp;quot;. This is just a slice of the paper (which contained some pros to Trump&amp;#39;s tax plan) but I figured I would just link to the source instead of trying to summarize something that I am not at all qualified to. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The final point that I will touch on is the hate mongering. Trump constantly uses fear of minorities in order to build support for himself. The whole idea of building a wall, which he constantly pushes, is built on the back of xenophobia towards Mexicans. He has called for restrictions on muslim immigration, which is clearly islamophobic and a violation of the idea of separation of church and state.  He has encouraged violence at his rally against protesters, excusing his two of his supporters for attacking a homeless  man by saying that they were &amp;quot;very passionate&amp;quot;, saying &amp;quot; If you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would you? Seriously. Okay? Just knock the hell \u2014 I promise you, I will pay for the legal fees.\u201d, \u201cI\u2019d like to punch [a protester] in the face, I\u2019ll tell ya\u201d, &amp;quot;\u201cMaybe [a protester who was attacked by several trump supporters] should have been roughed up because it was absolutely disgusting what he was doing.\u201d These are only things that Trump has defended, but I think that the worse part is that he has not condemn the most terrible acts his supporters have committed, such as a supporter yelling &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOteZSaejh8\"&gt;&amp;quot;go to fucking auschwitz&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; and another supporter saying &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oe8aLgbO98\"&gt;go back Africa&lt;/a&gt;. I can&amp;#39;t support any candidate who doesn&amp;#39;t completely condemn this type of behavior, and as a minority it terrifies me that a person who thinks it is ok to act like this is running for President of the United States of America (though my ethnicity has not been actively attacked by Trump except for a few remarks).
