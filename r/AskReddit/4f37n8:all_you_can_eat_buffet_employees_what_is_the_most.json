Been eating nothing but ramen &amp; instant oatmeal since Gatlinburg. I was getting hungry, OK? I was having dreams about meat. \n\nSo my friend and I hiked down from the trail to this tiny town, Catawba, Virginia, that only has one restaurant, [the Homeplace](http://www.yelp.com/biz/home-place-restaurant-catawba)--***All You Can Eat Fried Chicken.***\n\nWe walk in. We sit down. A waitress brings us a platter of fried chicken and a basket of homemade biscuits. And whenever we start running low, she *brings another platter.* \n\nIt's not like most buffets, where the food's crappy and watery and sugary but at least it's unlimited. No. It's the *best damn fried chicken* I've ever tasted. Crisp and juicy and greasy and just perfect.\n\nMe and my pal gorge on fried chicken. Eat at least 5lbs each. I'm starting to feel very uncomfortable, so when the waitress shows up with the next platter, I wave her off. She clears the table. \n\nAnd then she comes back carrying a ***motherfucking blackberry cobbler***.\n\nSo we polish off the cobbler (it would have been impolite not to), pay our bill, grab our backpacks from the foyer &amp; stand on the porch, contemplating the 1,500' climb back up to the trail. And it becomes obvious that there is no conceivable way we are climbing back up to the trail tonight. \n\nSo I go back inside and ask the hostess if there's anywhere to camp here in town, and she tells me, \"you're welcome to sleep in the gazebo out back.\" Apparently, this happens *all the time.*  \n\nEDIT: we were not the only hikers in the gazebo that evening.

Looked at it, said nothing, and just walked away back to his table.\n\n-Drunk dudes coming it around 6PM, they ate full plates in like 20 minutes, and puked everything under their table. We had to move every client out of this big section (capacity of about 60 places) because the smell was so bad. I was the one that had to put a mask on to clean everything.\n\n-Extremely fat guy brought a big bag of candies (kind of smarties), took it out of his pocket, put a shit ton of em on his desserts, and put the candy bag back in his pocket. I was his waiter and I think he told me about 4 times that we should have these candies in the buffet so he wouldn't have to bring his own.\n\n-Old lady putting a plate full of chicken wings in her purse (probably to bring back home or something)... no bags nothing, just bare chicken wings directly in there.\n\n-A regular client asking me where was the coffee flavored cake (we have a rotation for desserts, so that cake wasn't there that day). I told him and he asked me if I could get some for him in the back store. After he insisted like 3x, I finally gave up and grabbed a piece in the fridge and gave him.\n\n-We charge the drink (2.50$) but it's all you can drink. We see plenty of people drinking about 10 full glasses of Pepsi and they complain when I bring the bill and we charge them 2 bucks and a half for it. Some even insisted to talk to my manager.\n\n-We serve take-outs, and someone came to get his order. He looked at the buffet and asked me ''do you think I could grab something to eat real quick?'' while smiling. We often get this asked as a joke, so naturally I play their game and answered ''yes of course!''. The guy literally walked over there, took an entire egg from our salad bar, ate it in one bite, then came back to pay his take-out... I had no idea what to say, and he just left like that.\n\n\nI probably have more but those are the most obvious one. We have to deal with puke at least once a week (usually kids though). I don't even care anymore and find these situations rather funny.\n\n\nEDIT: Just thought of another one! We have an employee who does omelettes and eggs on demand, and one guy came and asked my coworker for eggs over. Naturally she asks ''1 or 2?'', and the guy answered ''8''. She initally thought it was a joke, but the guy wasn't laughing at all. She finally did all 8 eggs for him, and he ate them all in like 2 minutes.\n\nEDIT2: The buffet is located in Quebec City, Canada, so stop guessing random buffets around the country :P\n\nEDIT3: First time getting gold off of a comment, thanks!

He didn't say it, but his eyes begged for a slice.
