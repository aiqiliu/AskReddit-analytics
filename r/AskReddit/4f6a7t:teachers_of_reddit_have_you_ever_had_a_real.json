He was in my third grade class and it was clear right away he was smart. Could do any math we gave him, spell anything, reading on a level higher than we tested for. And I teach in a town that is pretty pretentious about its kids. Very high socioeconomic level, tons of kids go on to Ivy's. Many parents think their kid is a genius. Michael's mom  knew he was smart but didn't seem to get how smart. But he was never the kind to show off or want to impress people. He loved learning and was so excited to share it with everyone. \n\nSome noteworthy things he did- \n\n-taught himself about the stock market. His mom wouldn't let him invest money so he invested theoretical amounts and then showed her what it would have earned. \n\n- came in with an autobiography of George Bush to read during silent reading. Not a kid version, the official biography. He was able to tell me all about it, and commented that he disagrees with Bush politically, but felt bad for him because he thought he was pushed into politics by wanting to live up to his dad but wasn't happy in it. \n\n- noticed that some languages have similarities, so started mapping out how he thought they were related. This was in second grade. In third grade he showed me his map and I told him about language family trees and he was so excited. He got really into language isolates and wanted to learn Basque.\n\n- related to this he made himself flashcards of Greek and Latin roots to help his spelling and vocabulary.\n\n- taught himself hexadecimal and binary, and was working on other computer languages. \n\n- he was incredibly socially intuitive and empathetic. He would say to me 'I think so and so is upset' and the kid in question would be fine. Inevitably before the day ended that kid would have a meltdown or ask to talk to me about an issue. I learned fast to trust Michael's judgement. This also made him a really great friend. He did it with me too. He'd ask if I was OK and id be having a really rough day. It was so strange but sweet to have this tiny kid say things like \"let me know what I can do to support you today.\"\n\n- thought of another!

He rarely went to the lectures he had signed up for and could be found sitting in the back of classes of every subject you could imagine. He was a socially very engaged person whose enthusiasm was exhausting. His final GPA was very mediocre, a fact that did not bother him in the slightest; he had no interest in the minutiae of undergraduate study.  He was working at a Ph.d level and beyond  in his final undergraduate year, sucking every bit of information out of his professors. He ultimately become a hi-tech multi millionaire.\n\n* Student #2 may be what you are looking for and is the only example I have encountered.  This was a very shy and humble young man who took a long time to get to know, but was very engaging once you did. He came from a working class family with no history of higher education, and worked long hours at McDonald's. The first thing  I noticed was the truly extraordinary quality of his work,  effortlessly solving problems that previous students  had not even come close to solving. His ability to pick up complex ideas and even extend them was unrivaled; other professors reported the same. Pressures of work and many other problems resulted in him not turning up to class often, he still would ace the course. In his final term he did not attend a single class in any subject, he simply turned up for the final exam and midterm. He won the undergraduate gold medal for the university. He sadly now is socially dysfunctional, unemployed and has been in trouble with the law. I always felt the system did not serve him well.

This was at a school that is known for having some of the \"smartest\" students around, at least in the on-paper sense that that had great grades and test scores, and this was in a class that attracted a lot of the highest achievers (read: pre-med requirement).   She had the highest average for all the regular graded work (labs, problem-sets, exams), but there is only so far you can stand apart from the others with those, particularly at a school like that.  What allowed me to be completely blown away by her was her research papers.  \n\nThis was one of those core courses that had multiple professors, so we had to standardize the material, and there was a standard rubric for how the students were supposed to write the research papers: what essential questions they should be answering along the way, how to do the primary literature research, and how to cite your sources.  The papers I got always fell into two categories: The \"C\" (or below) papers and the \"A\" papers.  The \"C\" papers were from the students who, for some reason, didn't really get it with the rubric and still wrote like it was a high school paper where they were obviously just re-wording what they read on Wikipedia, plus some light cut-and-paste plagiarism from the abstracts of papers they clearly never read, and not enough citations.  The \"A\" papers were from students who simply followed the rubric to the letter, they answered every question in the paper consecutively as it was written in the rubric, cited their sources (always reading and using just enough papers to be sufficient, and no more), with the occasional sprinkling or more subtle cut-and-paste plagiarism.  These papers were usually dull as dirt, but often never even has so much as a typo, so I pretty much had to give them an \"A\" because they did what I asked them to do.  I never liked including the research papers in this course because the students were clearly not mature enough to really tackle the material in a productive way.  They were fine freshman papers, but a waste of everyone's time in the end.\n\nThen, one day, I had this student in my class.  She never followed the rubric and its dopey questions at all.  She thought of her own questions for the topic, the ones that were the most interesting and relevant to that topic specifically, many of these questions were truly insightful and open-ended as well.  She went into the literature and really read, and clearly understood, these papers that should have been way over the head of any normal teenage college student.  Then, on top of that, she would obtain the data from these papers and run her own, different analyses using very complex methodologies that I didn't teach until the most advanced courses for seniors and graduate students, so she was clearly just teaching herself as she went along.  Lastly, she was a terrific writer, maybe one of the best I've ever read.  Her papers always came in way too long for the limit (usually a sign the paper was an editing nightmare) and I loved reading every word.  She knew how long the paper needed to be to cover the topic, and my \"limits\" were just suggestions she chose to ignore and rightfully so.  She is the type of student I think should get an \"A\", not the other i-dotters and t-crossers, but alas in the world of grade-inflation about 25% of my students always got \"A\"s.

I've also had kids who were geniuses in English, and you can bet that those were the kids who were sending me short stories, poems, and even once a whole novel that they had written in their spare time and asking me for my opinion about it or just because they were excited to share with someone. The thing they all had in common was that they spent time on their passion, learning things about it independently.

I'm a teacher now and have had a number of very bright students, but there is a world of difference between him and them.  I'm fairly bright myself, at the very low end of what qualifies as 'genius', and most of my bright students are around that level give or take.  This childhood friend was not.  He was on an entirely different level.  \n\nHe excelled at math, science, and music.  He was composing music I'd still consider quite good when he was 7.  He was taking calculus by 5th grade and had studied as much calculus as taught by the university in my metro area by 8th grade.  He always took first place in our state for math competitions.  He invented a bidding system for bridge when he was in 10th grade that won me a national championship.  He designed programs to figure out ideal shapes for speaker enclosures given the shape of a room and built his own extremely complex speaker setups.  He made his own professional quality stringed instruments.  This was all before college.  I lost touch with him when he went to MIT.  Because I was friends with him I cannot use the term genius loosely, he was  legitimately one and I have met very few others anywhere near his level.  \n\nIt is hard to judge education versus genius, so I cannot judge my teachers, so there is only one other person I have met who I'd consider a genius.  When I was taking night courses at Harvard I'd sit in on day courses.  In a number of philosophy courses I attended there was one young woman who stood out from the rest.  She was able to dissect very difficult issues, articulate exactly the right examples of distinctions, and ask incredibly insightful questions that showed she not only understood the subject matter but was permuting it to apply to other situations in a way which confirmed her understanding and helped everyone else in the room get a better handle on the subject at the same time.  \n\nI have taught many bright people since.

We're talking verbal abuse, sexual harassment (verbal and physical of both teachers and students), and constant manipulation and lying. They clearly know the difference between \"right\" and \"wrong\" but choose to do the wrong thing almost always just to fuck with people. If you stroke their ego they'll stop acting out temporarily, but asking them to do something without bothering someone is near impossible.\n\nPersonally I think it's a control thing; the kid doesn't have a mom or dad and apparently had a rough childhood. Spent most of their childhood with older people who were terrible role models. They haven't had much control over their life thus far, so they bully people and constantly manipulate &amp; push boundaries to get that feeling. Most kids just do their work and show it to family at home to feel control; like \"yeah I accomplished something and someone cares!\". Instead this kid only gets that feeling by hurting others and watching their reactions. They reach out for attention in terrible ways just to receive any of it. I have never seen this kid do one nice thing on their own accord.\n\nRegardless of their family situation, I legitimately hate this kid. I never thought in a million years I would say that about a student. You go to school for teaching with idealistic views like \"yeah every kid is worth it!\" Seriously, fuck this kid. They're the biggest asshole I've ever met in my life. They might not be later on in their life, but right now they're the most hurtful human being I've ever come across. I've never met someone so intentionally mean that has literally never done something nice for someone else.\n\nTheir grades honestly aren't that good. Might be failing a class or 2, and the rest are average C's or so. It's not because they don't know material, it's simply because they're a lazy student who won't apply themselves or put in effort. The kid is legitimately smart in some ways.
