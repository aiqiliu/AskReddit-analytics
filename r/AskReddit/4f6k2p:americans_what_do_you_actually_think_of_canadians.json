All along the border, the Quebec hordes start their snowmobiles. Behind them, rank after rank of maple syrup launchers check their loads and calibrate the catapults. As the first rays peek above the horizon, the troops roll forward, throwing poutine into blockhouses and trenches.\n\nDawn, the banks of the Detroit river. Thousands of skate wearing, stick wielding shock troops line up in waves behind the sacrificial lambs that once were known as Toronto Maple Leafs, now fulfilling their destiny as cannon fodder. At least their collapse this time will serve their country.\n\nAs the wave skates forward, they throw hockey pucks. The starving masses of Detroit residents think they are overdone \"Really Big Macs\"^^TM, eat them and die a horrible death when trying to expel them later. This becomes notorious in history as the \"Eh, sorry\" atrocity.\n\nVancouver launches south into hipster territory, disguised as Lumbersexuals but in this case, they actually know how to operate their chainsaws, mauls, axes and peaveys. Within days, every craft brewery has been seized and held hostage. The west coast surrenders immediately.\n\nSaskatchewan and Manitoba invade North Dakota. No one notices. The Pentagon denies there is any such place. The White House calls for a good map to check if they care. They don't. South Dakota immediately surrenders to avoid losing its best and only friend.\n\nStunned and shocked by this blizzardkrieg, the rest of the northeast reels. When informed that the Canadian troops are backed up by another snowstorm of epic proportions, projected to drop over 5 feet of drifting, blowing snow in the next 24 hours, to be followed by -30F temperatures, refugees stream southward. Those left immediately accept Quebec's demands that they start using -34C in their forecasts. This induces even more Americans to flee, since they think it is now going to be even colder. Quebec's psy-ops campaign is working.\n\nFanning out south, the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois deep infiltration teams are first thought to be aliens because of their strange language. Someone recognizes one or two words, and bring up a French diplomat to translate. He can't understand them either. Reports of confirmed aliens spark mass riots in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.\n\nBy the end of the first week, Canada is firmly in control of the northern third of the US. Ruthlessly, they apply their free health care system on the Occupied Territories. Thousands are cruelly cured. In related attacks, paratroopers jump into the liberal enclaves of Marin County and the Los Angeles basin, and forcibly vaccinate every child whose parent has only a room temperature IQ. Protests are organized, but don't come off well since somebody forgot to bring enough arugula.\n\nReeling from the shock, no one knows how to react. In a stunning blow, the Canadian government threatens to unleash its long dreaded Top Secret Weapon on the airwaves. The entire US, including Alaska and Hawaii, surrender unconditionally rather than be subjected to a 24 hour all channel broadcast of Justin Bieber. Hundreds of thousands of pre-pubescent girls lock themselves in their room and refuse to come out if their parents don't DO SOMETHING about it.\n\nAfter three weeks, the country is quiet. Our new overlords divide the US into five main regions: \"You-over-there-on-the-west-side\", \"Southern Quebec and de Jersey Shore\", \"Big Rocky Place plus some deserts\", \"Flat Land for growing stuff\", and \"All the rest of you\". Florida is excluded from the provincial structure and set aside as a reserved for Canadian nationals only \"Place to Warm Up When We Need To\".\n\nMexico accepts millions of refugees and immediately puts them to work mowing lawns and picking crops. All are forced to learn Spanish but refused schooling.\n\nThe world accepts the fait accompli. (See? Some French in there to sooth Quebec sensibilities.) Tabarnak!

The result is subtle, yet powerful.  Canadians do not question authority, while American's will look for any excuse to throw tea in the harbor.  Taxation is vastly different.  The idea that gun ownership is a constitutional right to protect yourself from the government is distinctly American.  \n\nCanadians are polite, while Americans are friendly.  Kings of small talk, Canadians have politeness down to an art (and national identity), while Americans are more likely to be rude as they are giving you the shirt off their backs.

It validated so many jokes.\n\nBut seriously, Montreal is one of my favorite cities. It was very nice, walkable, and I really enjoyed the murals and street art. Quebec City was gorgeous, and whatever street festival we stumbled upon was great. Is that a typical Sunday thing in Quebec?
