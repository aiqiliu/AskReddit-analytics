I got these from an InfoWars article titled \"33 conspiracy theories that turned out to be true\".  I didn't include them all, though, because several of them seemed pretty far-fetched.  Most of these I'd heard of before.\n\n * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_affair  TL;DR:  In the late 1800s in France, Jewish artillery officer Alfred Dreyfus was wrongfully convicted of treason based on false government documents, and sentenced to life in prison.\n\n * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra  TL;DR:   In the 1950s to the 1970s, the CIA ran a mind-control project aimed at finding a \u201ctruth serum\u201d to use on communist spies. Test subjects were given LSD and other drugs, often without consent, and some were tortured.\n\n * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird TL;DR:  In the 1950s to \u201970s, the CIA paid a number of well-known domestic and foreign journalists to publish CIA propaganda.\n\n * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project TL;DR:  The codename for a project conducted during World War II to develop the first atomic bomb. Entire towns were built for short periods of time, employing people, all under secrecy and top national secrecy at that.  \n\n * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asbestos#Discovery_of_toxicity  TL;DR:   Between 1930 and 1960, manufacturers did all they could to prevent the link between asbestos and respiratory diseases, including cancer, becoming known, so they could avoid prosecution.\n\n * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watergate_scandal TL;DR:  Republican officials spied on the Democratic National Headquarters from the Watergate Hotel in 1972. While conspiracy theories suggested underhanded dealings were taking place, it wasn\u2019t until 1974 that White House tape recordings linked President Nixon to the break-in and forced him to resign. \n\n * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_syphilis_experiment TL;DR:  The United States Public Health Service carried out this clinical study on 400 poor, African-American men with syphilis from 1932 to 1972. During the study the men were given false and sometimes dangerous treatments, and adequate treatment was intentionally withheld so the agency could learn more about the disease.\n\n * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayirah_%28testimony%29 TL;DR:   A 15-year-old girl named \u201cNayirah\u201d testified before the U.S. Congress that she had seen Iraqi soldiers pulling Kuwaiti babies from incubators, causing them to die. The testimony helped gain major public support for the 1991 Gulf War.\n\n * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gladio TL;DR:  The clandestine NATO \u201cstay-behind\u201d operation in Italy after World War II, intended to continue anti-communist resistance in the event of a Warsaw Pact invasion of Western Europe.\n\n * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO TL;DR: COINTELPRO (an acronym for Counter Intelligence Program) was a series of covert, and often illegal, projects conducted by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) aimed at investigating and disrupting dissident political organizations within the United States.\n\n * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Contra_affair TL;DR:  In 1985 and \u201986, the White House authorized government officials to secretly give weapons to the Israeli government in exchange for the release of U.S. hostages in Iran, and in hopes that they would use the money to fund the Contras in Nicaragua. The plot was uncovered by Congress in 1987. \n\n * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Credit_and_Commerce_International TL;DR:  Investigators in the U.S. and the UK revealed that BCCI had been \u201cset up deliberately to avoid centralized regulatory review, and operated extensively in bank secrecy jurisdictions. Its affairs were extraordinarily complex. Its officers were sophisticated international bankers whose apparent objective was to keep their affairs secret, to commit fraud on a massive scale, and to avoid detection.\u201d \n\n * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegations_of_CIA_drug_trafficking TL;DR:  The CIA was pretty naughty.\n\n * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Tonkin_incident TL;DR:  This was also the single most important reason for the escalation of the Vietnam War, but looks like it was a false report.\n\n * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Plot TL;DR:   In 1933, group of wealthy businessmen that allegedly included the heads of Chase Bank, GM, Goodyear, Standard Oil, the DuPont family and Senator Prescott Bush tried to recruit Marine Corps Major General Smedley Butler to lead a military coup against President FDR and install a fascist dictatorship in the United States.\n\n * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat TL;DR:  The US and Britain overthrew a democratically elected President of Iran and backed a Shah, because they wanted oil.\n\n * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Snow_White TL;DR: The Church of Scientology managed to perform the largest infiltration of the United States government in history. Ever.  5,000 of Scientology\u2019s crack commandos wiretapped and burglarized various agencies. They stole hundreds of documents, mainly from the IRS.
