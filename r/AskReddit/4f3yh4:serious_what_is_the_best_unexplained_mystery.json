Both men were last spotted being arrested by deputy Steve Calkins for driving without a license. Neither men were taken to the jail. They just disappeared. His story is that he dropped both men off at Circle K convenience stores and drove away. There isn't as much evidence to go on with Santos' disappearance, but his story was actively disputed by the available evidence when it comes to Terrance's disappearance. For instance, he had Terrance's car towed and told the tow operator that the car was abandoned. But there were witnesses who saw him pull over Terrance and arrest him. What did he do with these men???\n\nMy own theory is that he gave them a Starlight ride: in other words, he drove them into the wilderness and dropped them off for them to walk home and they died of exposure/dehydration.

The mob and the coal companies effectively owned everything. The families in that area of the state had very close ties to Benito Mussolini and did not take criticism lightly. They really did control West Virginia at the time and today their influence can still be felt. It's suspected that the man who tried to sell them life insurance in October 1945 was really selling protection.\n\nThe father of the family openly criticized Mussolini and was against him as a leader for the Italian people. It's suspected that the man who inspected and rewired the house was a mob man and he planted an incendiary device in the attic.\n\nOn the night of the fire it's thought that the mob man was waiting outside listening for the phone to ring, he then waited for the mother to go back to bed and slipped into the barn where they were finishing up their last chores for the night and took the children away, it's thought that of the missing children, one of them did die in the fire (they found bone fragments of vertebrae younger than 24 in an excavation), but the others went with the man. He then activated the incendiary device and left with the children. \n\nThe father's vehicles were sabotaged, the ladder was gone (it was later found thrown down an embankment some distance away),  their Christmas lights stayed on even though they should of gone out if it was an electrical fire, and the phone line was cut. \n\nThere was also a man arrested for stealing a block and tackle from the house just before the start of the fire. He denied any involvement in the fire itself, but said that he cut the phone line thinking it was the power line so they couldn't see him in the yard. The mother later said that if the power had been cut, they wouldn't of been able to see to get out and it would have killed them all. Luckily for that man, he was let go shortly after and his file disappeared.\n\nA woman reported seeing four of the children with an older Italian man at a hotel and they appeared to be coerced into following him. One of the children, Louis supposedly popped up in Texas in the 60s when he got drunk and started talking about it. One of the girls supposedly popped up in NYC in the early 50s doing ballet. The other two are said to have popped up in Sicily in the early 60s. One working as a prostitute at a mob house and the other visiting her.\n\nOverall the general conclusion of those around here (who aren't connected to the Italian Mob) is that the mob wanted to kill the entire family for being anti-Mussolini, but a wrench was thrown in their plans when the four kids were in the barn. One child did die in the fire, but the other four were taken by the mob.

Each wore a formal suit, a lead eye mask, and a waterproof coat. There were no signs of trauma and no evidence of a struggle in the surrounding area. Next to the bodies, police found an empty water bottle and a packet containing two wet towels.
