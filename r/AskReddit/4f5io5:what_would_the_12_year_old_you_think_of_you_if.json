The pain to me wasn't much, and a little nausea or puking isn't actually out of the norm for my day to day. I waited 10 hours before going to the hospital because I am an idiot.  Within a few days of the heart attack I had my first stents put in.  My heart has blockages elsewhere however and isn't draining blood very well. So in a week or so I get more stents put in.  I am 38, with ironically good stats, 50bpm resting pulse, low blood pressure, low body fat, so the heart attack was a bit of a surprise to me.
