Job is simple enough:  suck out the oil/water with the vacuum hose from the top, then drop the hose in all the way, climb down with a shovel, and shovel the wet sand into the hose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This one had a guest.  A really big snapping turtle.  And it was angry.  I tried lifting it out with the vacuum (the hose would make a good enough seal on the top of the shell to lift it) but it would always claw at the edge of the manhole, pull itself loose, and drop back in.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ended up sucking most of the water out, lowering a bucket on a rope, and managed to get it to drop into the bucket.  Then hauled it out and dumped it in the nearby wooded area that it presumably came from in the first place.  Goodness that thing was mad.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2s3twb", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462368822.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462340022.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 10}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hp6xu", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2rv9u5", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "CrimsonWind", "parent_id": "t3_4hp6xu", "score": 9, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Ffs OP, use a serious tag next time, this thread is filled with karma whores.
