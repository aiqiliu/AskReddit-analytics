This girl who was my first kiss and first love turned out to be cheating on me and despite that I still loved her until she broke up with me. We got back together a couple times but things were never the same. I hear she&amp;#39;s addicted to drugs now. There&amp;#39;s a lot of things I hate about her but I still look back on the positives and even though we hardly talk and it&amp;#39;s been 3 years, I still love her&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2qxjt5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462308548.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462279748.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hmhuh", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2qyydr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "adz94", "parent_id": "t3_4hmhuh", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I met this guy from another country (like 10.000 away) on the internet, we got closer, I liked him, he liked me.

It all stared when I was in grade 8. I was a bit of a loner and every lunch break I would usually spend walking around in the field until we had to go back to class. That is how every year began and Every year I would join up with another group of misfits who eventually started fitting in somewhere and I would end up alone again. That year I started hanging out with two kids from my class. The first day I hung out with them we went to the middle of the field so they could play with their Yu-Gi-Oh cards and I would watch. I wasnt that into Yu-Gi-Oh cards but it gave me something to do during lunch breaks. Anyhow, they met up with another friend of theirs who would do these Yu-Gi-Oh battles with them. She was short with hay colored hair and brown eyes and she enjoyed playing Yu-Gi-Oh. Since that day we began to hang out every lunch break and my feeling for (lets call her M) slowly developed. There are some distinct moments I remember but those are too cheesy to say, haha. Instead I'll tell you of some of the lesser cheesy moments. One day after school I was heading to the bus stop to go home and I saw M walking in front of me so I caught up with her and we walked to the crossroad and went our separate ways. Since then everyday I would rush out of my class and wait by the stairs till she came out and I would go out, catch up to her and say hi and we would walk together. Once a kid came up to us and started laughing and doing the whole haha-you-guys-are-a-couple thing and she had this ... I guess you could call it a habit, whenever people bugged her or something she would just walk by looking straight ahead without acknowledging the person even exists. So she did that while I did the whole \"What?! No We're Not! We're Just Friends.\" But inside I felt super happy thinking that we looked like a couple. Anyway, as the school year went by my feelings for M kept on growing but before I knew it summer break started and I didnt have any way to communicate with her. This was back before facebook and everyone owning a cellphone. I had decided that I would ask her out the next time I saw here but due to family circumstances I had to move unexpectedly back to my home country. \n\nBUT The Story Doesnt End There!\n\nFive years later I came back. I did try to look for her but to no avail. That went on for two more years along with everything else in my life, university and all that, until I decided to go met my old middle school teacher. I didnt go to find M I just wanted to meet my teacher because she was one of my favorite ones. Afterwards when I was leaving I though \"fuck it\" and went back to ask her about M and I got her last name. That was enough to try and search facebook again but again it was to no avail. I ended up finding a girl with the same last name as M who had also gone to the same school as her so I sent her a message to see if she was related in any way to her. My shot in the dark worked! It was M's sister. It turns out M didnt have a facebook account at the time but she had an email that she gave to me through her sister and we set a date to meet up in downtown! I was ecstatic! After seven years I would see M again!! That day we had planed to meet up at a Tim's but because I was so over exited I ended up getting there a hour early so I just walked around the block till it was time to meet up. I went inside and there she was. Same hair, same eyes but she had glasses now and a bit taller. It was M. I dont know how to describe my joy! That day we planed to watch a movie(Prometheus IIRC) and then go to the museum but by the time we got to the music it was closing. Instead we walked around Downtown. We spent hours that day just roaming the city. I did not want that day to end. It was one of the happiest moments in my life. That night I walked her back to her house and on the way I said something along the lines of \"Remember we use to walk down that way together after school\" She didnt. It hurt a bit.\n\nThe next time we planed to meet up we decided to go to the zoo but we had some miss communications and ended up just going to see a movie instead(Ice Age 3). That was when I asked the dreaded question \"Do you have a boyfriend?\" and she replied \"Yes.\" ... I felt everything shatter. I think she noticed. After that I fucked up and then continued to fuck up. I fucked up by listened to stupid advice from my friends and told her how I felt. I fucked up by trying to remain cool but acting stupid. I was seriously cringe worthy and I fucked up so bad. I lost her friendship that day and I dont think I will ever be able to fix it ... Well that is my story.
