Freshman year of college I was rushing a fraternity and partying my ass off. I felt fine about it for two months, friends, parties, girls, I thought it was dope even if I was getting shit on by the actives. We had one last party before initiation and it was mandatory, we were gonna have to complete one last 'challenge' to become an active. I woke up that day and looked in the mirror and felt like shit about myself, I was drunk all the time, my grades were shit, and I was blowing money left and right, but I felt too far into the process to quit. Cut to that night at the party and I'm about six beers deep and had just been told the final task, fuck a girl at the party and you're initiated. I was striking out really badly with pretty much every girl because, like I said, I was doubting if I was really into the whole frat thing, I wasn't. My big noticed me having a rough time and called me over to him, he handed me a tablet and told me he wanted me as a brother and was willing to help me out. I looked at my hand and, I swear to god, time slowed down. I had a choice and for the first time in my life I felt at a crossroad and depending on what I did I would live a totally different life. I looked back up and told my big, I still remember this verbatim, \"I don't want to be your brother\" and I walked out of the party. I got hate texts for leaving and threats to never tell anyone anything, or they'd kick my ass or get me expelled or sue me, but I ignored them. I realized in those two seconds not who I was but who I wasn't and I've never looked back. I'm still haunted by the fact that I almost raped a girl and gave it serious consideration but I didn't and I'm proud of that. I never told the Dean but someone else from my pc did and the frat was investigated and kicked off campus, thank god. It took me a long time to get over what happened because I went from being popular and having a social life to nothing overnight, I was completely iced by my former 'friends' but it was for the best.\n\nTLDR: almost raped a girl at a frat party", "edited": 1462380235.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m really late to the show but here&amp;#39;s my story. Freshman year of college I was rushing a fraternity and partying my ass off. I felt fine about it for two months, friends, parties, girls, I thought it was dope even if I was getting shit on by the actives. We had one last party before initiation and it was mandatory, we were gonna have to complete one last &amp;#39;challenge&amp;#39; to become an active. I woke up that day and looked in the mirror and felt like shit about myself, I was drunk all the time, my grades were shit, and I was blowing money left and right, but I felt too far into the process to quit. Cut to that night at the party and I&amp;#39;m about six beers deep and had just been told the final task, fuck a girl at the party and you&amp;#39;re initiated. I was striking out really badly with pretty much every girl because, like I said, I was doubting if I was really into the whole frat thing, I wasn&amp;#39;t. My big noticed me having a rough time and called me over to him, he handed me a tablet and told me he wanted me as a brother and was willing to help me out. I looked at my hand and, I swear to god, time slowed down. I had a choice and for the first time in my life I felt at a crossroad and depending on what I did I would live a totally different life. I looked back up and told my big, I still remember this verbatim, &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t want to be your brother&amp;quot; and I walked out of the party. I got hate texts for leaving and threats to never tell anyone anything, or they&amp;#39;d kick my ass or get me expelled or sue me, but I ignored them. I realized in those two seconds not who I was but who I wasn&amp;#39;t and I&amp;#39;ve never looked back. I&amp;#39;m still haunted by the fact that I almost raped a girl and gave it serious consideration but I didn&amp;#39;t and I&amp;#39;m proud of that. I never told the Dean but someone else from my pc did and the frat was investigated and kicked off campus, thank god. It took me a long time to get over what happened because I went from being popular and having a social life to nothing overnight, I was completely iced by my former &amp;#39;friends&amp;#39; but it was for the best.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: almost raped a girl at a frat party&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2rl6tv", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462340819.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462312019.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 43}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hmbx5", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hmbx5", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 10, "parent_id": "t1_d2r1cgq", "children": ["d2rg46d", "d2rkdu4", "d2rc5x0", "d2rs6ai", "d2rlbqz", "d2re93z"], "name": "t1_d2rg46d", "id": "d2rg46d"}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2r1cgq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "attackofthe6pack", "parent_id": "t1_d2qyqp8", "score": 25, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Some guys I went to school with did this with the outlet.
