So one night I had some friends over and my mom was tanked. She started talking about how she played softball in high school and how you really had to get into a deep squat to be a good catcher. So she started squatting in our kitchen, split her pants, then fell over. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then like two hours later she decided she needed to Raid the shit out of some bees. So she did that and got stung a bunch. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My friends didn&amp;#39;t come over much  after that. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2r9nj6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462325973.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462297173.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 320}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hn6bt", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hn6bt", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 1, "parent_id": "t1_d2rmuim", "children": ["d2rx4rg"], "name": "t1_d2rx4rg", "id": "d2rx4rg"}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2rmuim", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "beepbeepitsajeep", "parent_id": "t1_d2ra4fh", "score": 75, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Doing this.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doing this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2rmuim", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462343201.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462314401.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 75}}, {"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 12, "parent_id": "t1_d2ra4fh", "id": "d2rmm3k", "name": "t1_d2rmm3k", "children": ["d2rmm3k", "d2rnkyo", "d2rzyqu", "d2s8u14", "d2rt1pl", "d2s5ucr", "d2scbqh", "d2rvc3i"]}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2ra4fh", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Optimegabot", "parent_id": "t3_4hn6bt", "score": 443, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Was with my dad at the mall, and you know the people who approach you to answer the surveys??

My mother's family was \"working class\", many of which were trashy. My mother was clearly one of the trashy ones. My fathers family were immigrants but all became wealthy somewhat early on and were a bit more refined. Anyway, not that important, but basically there's was just this perceived dynamic that my mom was trashy and me and my brothers were always self conscious about that. \n\nSo fast forward a few years, my parents split up. In a few years my mom gets pregnant. Which you know was to he expected honestly. But then because she is aware of how my father's family ( who were grew up with more, and were still very close with) viewed her. So she knew this was just going to be icing on the cake for them. She basically decided to deny the pregnancy. No problem right? If she wants to buy herself a month or two go ahead.\n\nWell my genius mom decided she was going to deny the pregnancy the whole way through. How would she handle the birth of the twins she was  carrying? She had no clue, till this day we have no idea what she thought she was going to do. \n\nBut basically she forced us to play along, and waited until she was 5 months pregnant, and huuuuge to finally \"admit\" ( basically my dad just said to her we all know and have known for a month at least) it. \n\nBut yea there she was, waddling around with this massive stomach talking about having too much gas, and calling my Dad's new gf a \"whore\" for being in a relationship outside of marriage. Speaking about it now, it's the funniest thing I have ever heard of . but at the time I felt immense shame.

My mother&amp;#39;s family was &amp;quot;working class&amp;quot;, many of which were trashy. My mother was clearly one of the trashy ones. My fathers family were immigrants but all became wealthy somewhat early on and were a bit more refined. Anyway, not that important, but basically there&amp;#39;s was just this perceived dynamic that my mom was trashy and me and my brothers were always self conscious about that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So fast forward a few years, my parents split up. In a few years my mom gets pregnant. Which you know was to he expected honestly. But then because she is aware of how my father&amp;#39;s family ( who were grew up with more, and were still very close with) viewed her. So she knew this was just going to be icing on the cake for them. She basically decided to deny the pregnancy. No problem right? If she wants to buy herself a month or two go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well my genius mom decided she was going to deny the pregnancy the whole way through. How would she handle the birth of the twins she was  carrying?
