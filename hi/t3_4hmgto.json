Even if you ignore all the time travel expect the one with Kyle Reese he &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; should have been sent back to the T1 timeline. The fact that there was at least two prior time terminators in this timeline makes the &amp;quot;current&amp;quot; 1984 timeline even more confusing. Who sent them? How? Why didn&amp;#39;t this disrupt the original T1 timeline that plays out? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My whole theory here may fall flat on it&amp;#39;s face considering one last point. The only explanation is that Genisys didn&amp;#39;t take place in an altered timeline like all the other movies, Genisys takes place in an &lt;em&gt;alternate universe&lt;/em&gt;. This would alleviate any plot holes and would make sense if Genisys was intended to be a reboot of the series instead of a sequel, but I&amp;#39;m not sure what the case is.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2quhjz", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462300285.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462271485.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hmgto", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 5, "parent_id": "t1_d2r2uvw", "id": "d2rhbak", "name": "t1_d2rhbak", "children": ["d2rhbak"]}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2r2uvw", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "midnight_riddle", "parent_id": "t3_4hmgto", "score": 4, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Maybe not as big as some on here, but the TV show Monk was rife with these. \n\nThere was an episode where a museum tour guide steals a moon rock by switching it with a fake so no one realizes it's been stolen.
