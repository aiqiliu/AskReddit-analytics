In my 9 years with the company, I don&amp;#39;t recall ever being treated disrespectfully or unfairly by my management, or not given an opportunity to move up. My management, and even my co-workers have been nothing but enthusiastic about my work ethic, and willingness to move up and learn new things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know this isn&amp;#39;t everyone&amp;#39;s story, but I can honestly say i&amp;#39;m proud to be a Walmart Associate. So many of my managers and fellow co-workers have helped me develop as a worker, manager, and a leader.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2qxeg3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462308241.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462279441.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hmvix", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2qxxrq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "iwanttoplayit", "parent_id": "t3_4hmvix", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Chemist, not a bad job and is pretty cool, but not in the division I'd like to be in", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chemist, not a bad job and is pretty cool, but not in the division I&amp;#39;d like to be in&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2qxxrq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462309317.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462280517.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hmvix", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2qz6gl", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "rewfrew", "parent_id": "t3_4hmvix", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I work in IT.
