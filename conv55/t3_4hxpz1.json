Make weight and try to drink (your body is in such hardcore survival mode, your digestive system shuts down completely, you vomit everything up), so I do a cold plunge because believe it or not your legs will suck up water if your cells are dehydrated enough, finally start getting able to drink without vomiting about six hours later, eat and go to bed. I felt surprisingly good that next morning, but that&amp;#39;s probably just because I was stoked I didn&amp;#39;t die, first kid sucks and I beat him easily, but I feel extremely disoriented, get off the mat go into the trainer and my body is shaking, every muscle in my body is cramping violently, looked like something out you would see at an exorcism, fucking trainer does some Jackie Chan karate kid shit with water and salt packets, putting salt on me and rubbing it in with water, next match I can barely stand but I literally fall over and headlock the guy at the same time and had him on his back in a tight ass headlock but cant pin him, too fucking tired, dude basically rolls me over and just pushes me out of bounds till he was winning (push out was a point then, did it to me like 6 times), my coach understood but it was still very embarrassing, it took my body more than a month to recover in terms of not looking like a fucking zombie, and I actually never fully did if I&amp;#39;m being honest. Least now I&amp;#39;m fairly certain if I go to hell it won&amp;#39;t phase me that fucking much.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2tjhx3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462461602.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462432802.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hxpz1", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2t9eqj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "martonyo", "parent_id": "t3_4hxpz1", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Shit out a brick", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shit out a brick&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_d2t9eqj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1462440753.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462411953.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 0}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
