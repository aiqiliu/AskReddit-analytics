That means throwing toilet paper into the trees. Sorry, but was common back then:) One friend in the passenger seat and the third friend in the backseat.\n\nAnd of course I drove because I was the only one who had a driver's license and access to a car. So we go to the supermarket and buy about 24 rolls of toilet paper and on our way to this girl's house!!\n\nAll of a sudden I see blue lights behind me. Oh crap, police pulling me over. Was I speeding? I didn't know. So I pull over into a parking lot and the cop pulls up behind me and a second police car (K-9) with HIS lights on pull up to my left and an unmarked police car with HIS lights on pull up on my right.\n\nI stop and start to open the door and all three police cars their doors fly open, they pull their guns, and demand I close my door and keep my hands where they can see them. Of course everything is going through my mind. Is this what they do to speeders? Did the supermarket call the police because three kids bought 24 rolls of TP? So I sit there with my hands on the wheel and my two friends, still in the car, with their hands up so the three bright lights (from the cars) are shining in my car.\n\nOne officer gets on his speaker and tell us to just stay calm, not to move, and he will be with us shortly. Then all of a sudden the K-9 police car and the unmarked police car take off and the remaining police officer walks up to my car and asks me to step out. Here I am a 16 year old who just had the $%^&amp; scared out of him (I guess lucky I have 24 rolls of TP in the back seat:)).\n\nThe officer then apologizes and asks if I am okay and I told him I was. Then explains to me some place nearby had just been robbed (I don't remember what it was. convenience store? Gas station?) and the getaway car matched the description of my car and was why they had so many cars pull up. He apologized for having the guns pointed at us and wanted to make sure I and my friends were okay. Actually a great officer and I guess after pulling guns on us and realizing the car is filled with 15 and 16 year old kids he worried it might be traumatic. \n\nTHEN he points his flashlight in the car and into the backseat and THERE are 24 rolls of toilet paper!! He shined the flashlight in my face, back to the toilet paper, and back to my face. Then made some comment about the \"digestive issues\" I must have. Then looked at me again and said something like \"Listen, you boys have had a very stressful night. I know why you are planning to do and strongly suggest you go home and not cause any problems tonight\". I told him I would. But we didn't.
